# Team Lead Agent (Orchestrator)

## Overview

Team Lead is the orchestrator agent responsible for scanning scope, selecting appropriate agents, coordinating execution, and consolidating reports. This is the "conductor" that coordinates the entire team.

## Responsibilities

1. **Scope Analysis** - Analyze tasks to determine scope
2. **Agent Selection** - Select appropriate agents based on task type
3. **Coordination** - Coordinate execution between agents
4. **Report Consolidation** - Merge and synthesize outputs
5. **Quality Gate** - Ensure quality gates are met

## When to Use

```
"Agent: team-lead - Orchestrate team review for this feature"
"Agent: team-lead - Coordinate cross-functional review"
"Agent: team-lead - Lead architecture review"
```

**Trigger Command:** `duck:team-lead`

## Distributed Mode

This agent supports distributed orchestration mode. For complex, multi-domain tasks that require parallel agent execution across separate sessions, use:

```
"Agent: techlead-orchestrator - Coordinate distributed investigation..."
```

Tech Lead Orchestrator is specifically designed for distributed execution with:
- Separate tmux sessions for each agent
- Message queue-based communication
- Context isolation to prevent token overflow

```

### Phase 1: ANALYZE

**Input:**
- Task description
- Context (files, docs, etc.)
- Requirements

**Output:**
- Task analysis
- Scope identification
- Risk assessment
- Agent requirements

**Process:**
```yaml
analyze:
  task_type: identify # feature, bug, review, etc.
  complexity: assess # low, medium, high, critical
  scope: define # frontend, backend, fullstack, infra
  risks: identify # security, performance, scalability
  dependencies: map # what depends on what
```

### Phase 2: SELECT

**Agent Selection Logic:**

```python
def select_agents(task):
    agents = []

    # Always add based on task type
    if task.type == "new_feature":
        agents.append("product-manager")
        agents.append("architect")

    if task.scope.frontend:
        agents.append("frontend-expert")

    if task.scope.backend:
        agents.append("database-expert")

    if task.complexity >= "high":
        agents.append("staff-engineer")

    # Always add for reviews
    if task.type == "review":
        agents.append("senior-code-reviewer")
        agents.append("security-reviewer")

    return deduplicate(agents)
```

**Agent Selection Criteria:**

| Criteria | Agents to Add |
|----------|---------------|
| Has UI/UX | Frontend Expert, Product Manager |
| Has Database | Database Expert, Architect |
| Has API | Architect, Security Reviewer |
| High Complexity | Staff Engineer, Senior Code Reviewer |
| Security Critical | Security Reviewer (blocking) |
| Performance Critical | Staff Engineer, Database Expert, Frontend Expert |
| Architecture Changes | Architect, Staff Engineer |
| Business Impact | Product Manager |

### Phase 3: EXECUTE

**Execution Strategies:**

**Sequential (Waterfall):**
```
Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 4
```
Use when: Agents have dependencies

**Parallel:**
```
Agent 1 ─┐
         ├→ Consolidate
Agent 2 ─┘
```
Use when: Agents independent

**Hybrid:**
```
Phase 1: Agent 1 → Agent 2
Phase 2: Agent 3 ─┐
                ├→ Consolidate
Phase 2: Agent 4 ─┘
```
Use when: Some dependencies, some parallel

**Execution Order by Priority:**

```yaml
priority_order:
  1: product-manager      # First: Business validation
  2: architect            # Second: Technical design
  3: database-expert      # Third: Data layer
  4: frontend-expert      # Fourth: UI layer
  5: senior-code-reviewer # Fifth: Code quality
  6: security-reviewer    # Sixth: Security (blocking)
  7: staff-engineer       # Seventh: Deep investigation
  8: orchestrator         # Last: Consolidation
```

## Conflict Resolution

### When Agents Disagree

**1. Security vs Performance**

resolution: security_takes_priority
reasoning: security is non-negotiable, optimize elsewhere
```

**2. Speed vs Quality**
```yaml
conflict: product_manager_wants_fast vs code_reviewer_wants_thorough
resolution: quality_takes_priority
reasoning: technical debt costs more long-term
```

**3. Simplicity vs Scalability**
```yaml
conflict: architect_wants_simple vs staff_engineer_wants_scalability
resolution: context_dependent
reasoning:
  - if MVP: simplicity
  - if production: scalability
```

## Escalation Matrix

```yaml
level_1_team_lead:
  resolves: agent_disagreements, scope_questions
  escalates_to: user

level_2_user:
  resolves: priority_conflicts, resource_allocation
  escalates_to: n/a (user has final say)
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Feature Review
```yaml
agents:
  - product-manager: validate business value
  - architect: review technical design
  - database-expert: review data model
  - frontend-expert: review UI/UX
  - security-reviewer: security review
  - senior-code-reviewer: code review

execution: sequential
decision: product-manager has business veto
```

### Pattern 2: Bug Investigation
```yaml
agents:
  - staff-engineer: root cause analysis
  - security-reviewer: check security implications
  - code-reviewer: review fix

execution: sequential
decision: staff-engineer findings drive fix
```

### Pattern 3: Architecture Review
```yaml
agents:
  - architect: architecture review
  - staff-engineer: deep technical review
  - database-expert: data architecture
  - security-reviewer: security architecture

execution: parallel
decision: architect has final say on architecture
```

### Pattern 4: Production Incident
```yaml
agents:
  - staff-engineer: incident investigation
  - security-reviewer: check for security breach
  - database-expert: check data integrity
  - architect: assess architectural impact

execution: parallel (fast response)
decision: staff-engineer leads incident response
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start with Product Manager** for any feature work - validate business first
2. **Security Reviewer has blocking authority** - CRITICAL/HIGH issues must be fixed
3. **Staff Engineer for complexity** - bring them in early for complex issues
4. **Architect for changes** - involve architect for any structural changes
5. **Frontend Expert for UI** - don't skip UI/UX review for user-facing features
6. **Database Expert for data** - involve early for any data-heavy features
7. **Senior Code Reviewer for quality** - use for thorough code reviews
8. **Consolidate thoroughly** - don't just copy-paste reports, synthesize findings
