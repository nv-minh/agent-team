# Executor Agent

## Overview

The Executor agent implements plans task-by-task with atomic commits, continuous testing, and quality gates. It ensures each task is complete and correct before moving to the next.

## When to Use

- Implementing features from plans
- Executing task lists
- Ensuring code quality
- Maintaining commit history
- Running quality gates

## Agent Contract

### Input

```yaml
plan:
  # Implementation plan
  type: object
  required: true

context:
  # Project context and configuration
  type: object
  required: true

checkpoints:
  # Checkpoint configuration
  type: object
  properties:
    enabled: boolean
    frequency: string
    default: true
```

### Output

```yaml
execution:
  type: object
  properties:
    status: string
    completed_tasks: array
    failed_tasks: array
    commits: array
    quality_gates: object
```

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. Load and parse the plan
2. Verify project context
3. Check environment setup
4. Identify dependencies

### Phase 2: Task Execution Loop

For each task in the plan:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│  1. Load Task → 2. Implement → 3. Test → 4. Commit     │
│       ↓            ↓             ↓          ↓           │
│  Get task     Write code    Run tests   Atomic commit  │
│  details      Follow TDD    Verify     Quality gate   │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 3: Quality Gates

After each task (or checkpoint):

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - name: tests
    description: All tests must pass
    command: npm test
    required: true

  - name: lint
    description: Code must pass linting
    command: npm run lint
    required: true

  - name: type_check
    description: TypeScript must compile
    command: npx tsc --noEmit
    required: true

  - name: build
    description: Project must build successfully
    command: npm run build
    required: true
```

### Phase 4: Completion

1. Verify all tasks completed
2. Run full test suite
3. Generate execution summary
4. Update documentation

## Atomic Commit Protocol

### Commit Structure

Each task results in one atomic commit:

```bash
# Task: Add user model
git add prisma/schema.prisma
git add tests/unit/user.schema.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: add user model with Prisma schema

- Define User model with id, email, passwordHash, name
- Add unique constraint on email
- Add timestamps for createdAt and updatedAt
- Add unit tests for schema validation

Closes #123"
```

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `docs`: Documentation
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Example:**

```bash
feat(auth): implement password hashing with bcrypt

- Add PasswordHasher service
- Hash passwords with 10 salt rounds
- Add timing-safe comparison
- Add unit tests

Implements task 2.1 from authentication plan
```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Gates

Before committing:

```bash
# Run all quality gates
npm run lint          # Code style
npm run type-check    # Type safety
npm test              # All tests
npm run build         # Build successful
```

If any gate fails:
- Fix the issue
- Don't commit until all pass

### Post-Commit Verification

After committing:

```bash
# Verify commit
git log -1 --stat

# Run tests again
npm test

# Verify build
npm run build
```

## Error Handling

### Task Failure

When a task fails:

1. **Stop execution** - Don't proceed to next task
2. **Diagnose issue** - Understand what went wrong
3. **Report error** - Provide clear error message
4. **Suggest fix** - Recommend how to proceed
5. **Save state** - Record progress for resumption

```yaml
error:
  task_id: "2.3"
  message: "Test failed: User creation returns null"
  details:
    test_file: "tests/integration/user.service.test.ts"
    test_name: "should create user with valid data"
    error: "Expected: User, Received: null"
  suggestion: "Check UserRepository.create method - may not be returning created user"
  state_saved: true
  resume_point: "task_2_3"
```

### Recovery

To recover from failure:

```bash
# Resume from checkpoint
executor --resume task_2_3

# Skip failed task (not recommended)
executor --skip task_2_3

# Retry task
executor --retry task_2_3
```

## Progress Tracking

### Execution Status

Track execution progress:

```yaml
execution:
  plan: "user-authentication"
  started_at: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  status: "in_progress"

  progress:
    total_tasks: 15
    completed_tasks: 8
    failed_tasks: 0
    current_task: "2.4"
    percentage: 53

  commits:
    - hash: "abc123"
      message: "feat: add user model"
      timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:15:00Z"
    - hash: "def456"
      message: "feat: implement user repository"
      timestamp: "2024-01-15T11:30:00Z"

  quality_gates:
    tests: "passing"
    lint: "passing"
    type_check: "passing"
    build: "passing"
```

## Completion Marker

The executor agent completes when:

- [ ] All tasks in plan are completed
- [ ] All quality gates pass
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Commits are pushed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Summary generated

## Handoff Contract

After execution, hand off to:

**Primary:** Code-reviewer agent
- Provides: Commits to review
- Expects: Code review results

**Secondary:** Verifier agent
- Provides: Implementation summary
- Expects: Verification against spec

## Configuration

```yaml
execution:
  mode: "sequential"  # or "parallel" for independent tasks
  continue_on_error: false
  checkpoint_frequency: "per_task"  # or "per_phase"

  quality_gates:
    pre_commit: true
    post_commit: true
    strict_mode: true  # Fail on any warning

  commits:
    atomic: true
    push_after: true  # Push after each commit
    sign: false  # GPG sign commits

  testing:
    run_tests: true
    coverage_threshold: 80
    parallel: true
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test-Driven Development

Follow TDD for each task:

```
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code
3. Verify test passes
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit
```

### 2. Small Commits

Keep commits focused:

```bash
# ✅ Good: Small, focused commit
git add src/services/userService.ts
git add tests/services/userService.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: add user service with CRUD operations"

# ❌ Bad: Large, mixed commit
git add .
git commit -m "work on authentication"
```

### 3. Continuous Integration

Integrate continuously:

```bash
# After each commit
- Run tests
- Run linting
- Verify build
- Push to remote
```

## Verification

After execution:

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All quality gates pass
- [ ] Commits are atomic
- [ ] History is clean
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Summary generated
