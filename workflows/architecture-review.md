# Architecture Review Workflow

## Overview

The Architecture Review workflow provides deep technical assessment of architectural designs, patterns, and decisions. It combines the Architect agent's expertise in design patterns with the Staff Engineer's deep technical investigation capabilities.

## When to Use

- New system architecture design
- Major architectural refactoring
- Microservices decomposition
- Architecture Decision Record (ADR) review
- Scalability assessment
- Integration design

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Architecture Analysis (Architect)

**Agent:** `duck:architect`

**Actions:**
- Identify architectural pattern (Layered, Hexagonal, Microservices, Event-Driven)
- Assess architectural principles (high cohesion, low coupling, separation of concerns)
- Review technical design
- Evaluate scalability and maintainability
- Review ADRs (if applicable)

**Input:**
- Architecture diagrams
- Technical design documents
- ADRs
- System requirements

**Output:** Architecture Review Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Architectural pattern identified
- [ ] Principles assessed
- [ ] Design reviewed
- [ ] Scalability evaluated
- [ ] Scorecard completed

---

### Stage 2: Deep Technical Review (Staff Engineer)

**Agent:** `duck:staff`

**Actions:**
- Cross-service impact analysis
- Dependency analysis
- Performance implications
- Integration complexity assessment
- Risk identification

**Input:**
- Architecture review from Architect
- System context
- Performance requirements

**Output:** Staff Engineering Technical Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Cross-service impact analyzed
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Performance implications assessed
- [ ] Risks identified

---

### Stage 3: Consolidated Architecture Assessment

**Agents:** `duck:architect` + `duck:staff`

**Actions:**
- Merge architecture and technical findings
- Identify architectural risks
- Prioritize recommendations
- Create actionable roadmap

**Output:** Consolidated Architecture Review Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Findings merged
- [ ] Risks prioritized
- [ ] Recommendations actionable
- [ ] Roadmap defined

## Architecture Pattern Assessment

### LAYERED ARCHITECTURE
```yaml
characteristics:
  - presentation_layer: UI, API controllers
  - business_logic_layer: Services, domain logic
  - data_access_layer: Repositories, DAOs
  - database_layer: Database, external services

  data_flow: unidirectional (top to bottom)
  dependencies: upper_layers depend_on lower_layers

  pros:
    - easy_to_understand
    - separation_of_concerns
    - testable

  cons:
    - can_become_rigid
    - hidden_latencies
    - logic_can_leak

    - straightforward_requirements
```

### HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE
```yaml
characteristics:
  - domain: Core business logic (no dependencies)
  - ports: Interfaces defined by domain
  - adapters: Implementations for ports

  types:
    - driving_adapters: UI, API, tests (drive domain)
    - driven_adapters: Database, APIs, messaging (driven by domain)

  data_flow: bidirectional through ports
  dependencies: all dependencies point inward

  pros:
    - domain is_independent
    - easy to swap_adapters
    - highly_testable
    - technology_agnostic

  cons:

    - long_term_maintainability_needed
```

### MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE
```yaml
characteristics:
  - independent_services: loosely coupled
  - own_database: each service owns its data
  - api_gateway: single entry point
  - service_mesh: inter-service communication

  pros:
    - independent_deployment
    - technology_diversity
    - fault_isolation
    - team_autonomy

  cons:
    - distributed_complexity
    - data_consistency challenges
    - operational_overhead
    - network_latency

  when_to_use:
    - multiple_teams
    - high_scaling_requirements
    - diverse_technology_needs
    - fault_isolation_critical
```

### EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE
```yaml
characteristics:
  - event_producers: emit events
  - event_broker: kafka, rabbitmq, etc.
  - event_consumers: process events

  patterns:
    - event_sourcing: store events as source of truth
    - cqrs: command_query_responsibility_separation
    - saga: distributed_transactions

  pros:
    - loose_coupling
    - async_processing
    - real_time_updates
    - scalability

  cons:
    - complexity
    - eventual_consistency
    - debugging_difficulty
    - message_ordering

  when_to_use:
    - async_processing_needed
    - real_time_updates_required
