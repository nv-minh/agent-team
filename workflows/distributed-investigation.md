# Distributed Investigation Workflow

## Overview

This workflow coordinates distributed agents across separate tmux sessions to investigate bugs or issues that span multiple domains (backend, frontend, database).

## When to Use

```
"Workflow: distributed-investigation - Investigate login bug across BE and FE"
"Workflow: distributed-investigation - Debug payment failure across multiple services"
"Workflow: distributed-investigation - Root cause analysis for performance degradation"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Cross-repo bug investigation
- Multi-domain performance issues
- Production incident response
- Complex bug requiring specialized expertise

## Prerequisites

1. **Distributed orchestration running:**
```bash
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh start
```

2. **Tech Lead Orchestrator active:**
```bash
# In techlead session
"Agent: techlead-orchestrator - Coordinate distributed investigation..."
```

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis

**Step 1:** Receive bug report from user

**Step 2:** Tech Lead analyzes bug to determine scope

```yaml
bug_analysis:
  description: "[User's bug report]"
  scope_analysis:
    - affected_domains: [backend, frontend, database, infrastructure]
    - severity: [critical, high, medium, low]
    - user_impact: [all_users, some_users, single_user]
    - reproduction_steps: [clear, unclear, unable]

  agent_selection:
    - if backend_impact: "backend-expert"
    - if frontend_impact: "frontend-expert"
    - if database_impact: "database-expert"
    - if complex: "staff-engineer"
    - if security_related: "security-reviewer"

  coordination_strategy:
    - if independent_domains: "parallel"
    - if dependent_domains: "sequential"
    - if mixed: "hybrid"
```

**Step 3:** Create investigation plan

```yaml
investigation_plan:
  task_id: "TASK-2026-001"
  title: "[Bug Title]"

  agents:
    - name: "backend-expert"
      session: "backend"
      priority: 1
      task: "[What to investigate]"
      dependencies: []

    - name: "frontend-expert"
      session: "frontend"
      priority: 2
      task: "[What to investigate]"
      dependencies: []

    - name: "database-expert"
      session: "database"
      priority: 3
      task: "[What to investigate]"
      dependencies: []

  execution_strategy: "parallel"  # or sequential/hybrid

  expected_outputs:
    - from: "backend-expert"
      format: "report"
      location: "/tmp/claude-work-reports/backend/bug-investigation-20260419.md"

    - from: "frontend-expert"
      format: "report"
      location: "/tmp/claude-work-reports/frontend/bug-investigation-20260419.md"

    - from: "database-expert"
      format: "report"
      location: "/tmp/claude-work-reports/database/bug-investigation-20260419.md"
```

---

### Phase 2: Task Delegation

**Step 4:** Tech Lead creates task assignments for each agent

```yaml
# Example task assignment for Backend Expert
message_type: task_assignment
timestamp: "2026-04-19T10:00:00Z"
from: techlead
to: backend
task_id: "TASK-2026-001-BE"

task:
  title: "Investigate login API latency issue"
  description: |
    Users reporting slow login times (>2s). Backend login endpoint
    /api/auth/login is slow. Investigate and identify root cause.

  priority: critical
  scope:
    in_scope: "Login endpoint /api/auth/login"
    out_of_scope: "Frontend login form"

  context:
    - "backend/api/auth/login.js"
    - "logs/production-2026-04-19.log"
    - "47 user complaints in last 24h"

  expected_output:
    format: report
    location: "/tmp/claude-work-reports/backend/login-latency-20260419.md"
    deadline: "2026-04-19T11:00:00Z"
```

**Step 5:** Write task assignments to message queue

```bash
# Tech Lead writes to queue
cat > /tmp/claude-work-queue/to-backend/TASK-001-BE.yaml << 'EOF'
[task assignment YAML]
EOF

# Notify Backend session
tmux send-keys -t claude-work:backend "echo '[New task: TASK-001-BE]'" C-m
```

**Repeat for each agent**

---

### Phase 3: Distributed Investigation

**Step 6:** Agents work independently in their sessions

**Backend Session:**
```bash
# Backend agent receives task
# Reads from: /tmp/claude-work-queue/to-backend/TASK-001-BE.yaml

# Performs investigation
- Analyzes login endpoint code
- Reviews database queries
- Checks external service calls
- Profiles performance

# Sends status update every 15 minutes
cat > /tmp/claude-work-queue/to-techlead/STATUS-backend-TASK-001.yaml << 'EOF'
message_type: status_update
from: backend
task_id: "TASK-001-BE"
status:
  state: in_progress
  progress_percent: 40
  current_step: "Analyzing database queries"
EOF
```

**Frontend Session:**
```bash
# Frontend agent receives task
# Performs investigation
- Reviews login form
- Checks API call timing
- Analyzes loading states
- Reviews error handling

# Sends status update
cat > /tmp/claude-work-queue/to-techlead/STATUS-frontend-TASK-001.yaml << 'EOF'
message_type: status_update
from: frontend
task_id: "TASK-001-FE"
status:
  state: in_progress
  progress_percent: 60
  current_step: "Measuring API response times"
EOF
```

**Database Session:**
```bash
# Database agent receives task
# Performs investigation
- Reviews login-related queries
- Checks indexes
- Analyzes query performance
- Checks for locks

# Sends status update
cat > /tmp/claude-work-queue/to-techlead/STATUS-database-TASK-001.yaml << 'EOF'
message_type: status_update
from: database
task_id: "TASK-001-DB"
status:
  state: in_progress
  progress_percent: 80
  current_step: "Analyzing slow queries"
EOF
```

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Agent Coordination

**Step 7:** Tech Lead monitors progress and coordinates

**Scenario:** Backend Agent needs frontend context

```yaml
# Backend requests guidance
message_type: request_guidance
from: backend
request:
  type: coordination
  subject: "Need frontend API timing data"
  context: "Backend login endpoint takes 2.3s. Need to know if frontend measures this."
  urgency: medium

# Tech Lead shares frontend findings
message_type: context_share
from: techlead
to: backend
context:
  type: findings_from
  source_agent: frontend
  content: "Frontend measures login API at 2.3s average. Loading states show at 0.5s."

action_required: "Use this timing data for backend optimization target."
```

**Scenario:** Database Agent finds indexing issue

```yaml
# Database reports findings
message_type: findings_report
from: database
findings:
  critical:
    - issue: "Missing index on users.email"
      impact: "Full table scan on every login"
      fix: "CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);"

# Tech Lead shares with Backend
message_type: context_share
from: techlead
to: backend
context:
  type: findings_from
  source_agent: database
  content: "Database found missing index on users.email causing full table scan."

action_required: "Factor this into backend latency investigation. This is likely the root cause."
```

---

### Phase 5: Report Collection

**Step 8:** Agents complete investigations and submit reports

**Backend Report:**
```markdown
# Backend Expert Report: Login API Latency Investigation

**Report ID:** RPT-2026-001
**Agent:** backend-expert
**Task ID:** TASK-2026-001-BE

## Executive Summary

Login API latency of 2.3s caused by missing database index and N+1 query problem.

## Findings

### Critical Issues
| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Missing index on users.email | Full table scan (500ms) | Add index |
| N+1 query loading permissions | 10+ queries (1.5s) | Use data loader |
| No response caching | Repeated queries | Add 5-min cache |

### Recommendations
1. Add database index on users.email (30 min)
2. Implement data loader for permissions (2 hours)
3. Add response caching (4 hours)
```

**File:** `/tmp/claude-work-reports/backend/login-latency-20260419.md`

**Frontend Report:**
```markdown
# Frontend Expert Report: Login UX Analysis

**Report ID:** RPT-2026-002
**Agent:** frontend-expert
**Task ID:** TASK-2026-001-FE

## Executive Summary

Login form has adequate loading states, but 2.3s API latency is too slow for good UX.

## Findings

### Medium Issues
| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Loading spinner shows late | Confusing UX | Show spinner immediately |
| No retry mechanism | Users give up | Add retry button |

### Recommendations
1. Show loading spinner immediately (15 min)
2. Add retry mechanism for failed logins (30 min)
```

**File:** `/tmp/claude-work-reports/frontend/login-ux-20260419.md`

**Database Report:**
```markdown
# Database Expert Report: Query Performance Analysis

**Report ID:** RPT-2026-003
**Agent:** database-expert
**Task ID:** TASK-2026-001-DB

## Executive Summary

Login queries slow due to missing index and N+1 query pattern.

## Findings

### Critical Issues
| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Missing index on users.email | Full table scan (500ms) | CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY |

### Recommendations
1. Add index on users.email (30 min)
2. Review user permissions query pattern (1 hour)
```

**File:** `/tmp/claude-work-reports/database/query-analysis-20260419.md`

---

### Phase 6: Consolidation

**Step 9:** Tech Lead collects all reports

```bash
# Collect reports
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh collect

# Consolidate into single report
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh consolidate
```

**Step 10:** Create consolidated investigation report

```markdown
# Consolidated Bug Investigation Report: Login Latency

**Report ID:** TEAM-RPT-2026-001
**Agents:** Backend, Frontend, Database

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Root Cause:** Missing database index + N+1 queries
**User Impact:** High (47 complaints in 24h)

## Root Cause Analysis

Login latency of 2.3s caused by:
1. **Primary:** Missing index on users.email (500ms overhead)
2. **Secondary:** N+1 query loading permissions (1.5s overhead)

## Consolidated Findings

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
| Issue | Agent | Impact | Fix | Effort |
|-------|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| Missing index on users.email | Database | Full table scan | Add index | 30 min |
| N+1 query for permissions | Backend | 10+ queries | Data loader | 2 hours |
| Late loading spinner | Frontend | Poor UX | Show immediately | 15 min |

## Cross-Agent Insights

**Backend-Database coupling:**
- Backend API slowness directly caused by missing database index
- Fix database → Backend improves automatically

**Backend-Frontend dependency:**
- Frontend UX depends on Backend API performance
- Fix backend → Frontend UX improves automatically

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. Add database index on users.email (Database) - 30 min
2. Implement data loader for permissions (Backend) - 2 hours
3. Show loading spinner immediately (Frontend) - 15 min

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Add response caching (Backend) - 4 hours
2. Add retry mechanism (Frontend) - 30 min

### Expected Outcome
- **Current:** 2.3s login time
- **After fixes:** <500ms login time
- **Improvement:** 4.6x faster

## Next Steps

1. Database Expert: Create index migration
2. Backend Expert: Implement data loader
3. Frontend Expert: Fix loading spinner
4. Staff Engineer: Verify fixes in staging
```

### Phase 7: Action & Resolution

**Step 11:** Tech Lead issues action items

```yaml
# Tech Lead assigns action items
message_type: action_item
to: database
action:
  priority: critical
  task: "Create database index migration"
  deadline: "2026-04-19T14:00:00Z"
  instructions: |
    Use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY for zero downtime.
    Test in staging first.

message_type: action_item
to: backend
action:
  priority: critical
  task: "Implement data loader for permissions"
  deadline: "2026-04-19T16:00:00Z"
  instructions: |
    Use dataloader library.
    Ensure batch size is appropriate.

message_type: action_item
to: frontend
action:
  priority: high
  task: "Fix loading spinner timing"
  deadline: "2026-04-19T13:00:00Z"
  instructions: |
    Show spinner immediately on form submit.
```

**Step 12:** Agents implement fixes

**Step 13:** Verification

```yaml
verification:
  - database_index_created: true
  - data_loader_implemented: true
  - loading_spinner_fixed: true
  - login_time_under_500ms: true
```

**Step 14:** Close investigation

```markdown
# Investigation Closed: Login Latency Bug

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Resolution Time:** 6 hours
**Final Outcome:** Login time reduced from 2.3s to 450ms

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Always review database indexes for authentication queries
2. Watch for N+1 query patterns in permission checks
3. Frontend UX depends heavily on backend performance
