# Incident Response Workflow

## Overview

The Incident Response workflow provides systematic production incident handling, combining the Staff Engineer's root cause analysis expertise with the Security Reviewer's security investigation capabilities.

## Modular Components

This workflow is split into focused components for better maintainability and token efficiency:

- **Overview:** [workflows/incident/overview.md](workflows/incident/overview.md)
- **Stage 1:** [Initial Assessment & Triage](workflows/incident/initial-triage.md) - Staff Engineer
- **Stage 2:** [Security Investigation](workflows/incident/security-investigation.md) - Security Reviewer (if applicable)
- **Stage 3:** [Root Cause Analysis](workflows/incident/root-cause-analysis.md) - Staff Engineer
- **Stage 4:** [Cross-Service Impact Analysis](workflows/incident/cross-service-impact.md) - Staff Engineer
- **Stage 5:** [Resolution & Verification](workflows/incident/resolution-verification.md) - Staff Engineer + Security Reviewer
- **Stage 6:** [Postmortem & Prevention](workflows/incident/postmortem-prevention.md) - Staff Engineer + Security Reviewer

## Quick Reference

### When to Use
- Production outages
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
- Data integrity issues
- Critical bugs in production
- Customer-impacting failures

## Root Cause Analysis Framework

### 5 Whys Method
```yaml
example_incident: API latency increased from 50ms to 500ms

why_1: Why did latency increase?
  answer: Database queries are taking longer

why_2: Why are database queries taking longer?
  answer: Query execution time increased from 10ms to 400ms

why_3: Why did query execution time increase?
  answer: Missing index on newly added column

why_4: Why was index not added?
  answer: Migration script didn't include index creation

why_5: Why didn't migration script include index?
  answer: No code review process for database migrations

root_cause: Lack of database review process
corrective_action: Implement mandatory DB review for migrations
```
