# New Feature Workflow

## Overview

The new feature workflow takes a feature from initial idea through to production deployment. It follows the complete development lifecycle with quality gates at each phase.

**ENHANCED:** Now includes optional market validation stage for strategic features and market-driven decisions.

## When to Use

- Building new features
- Adding functionality
- Implementing user stories
- Creating new capabilities
- Entering new markets
- Strategic feature planning

## Decision Framework: When to Use Market Validation

```yaml
decision_tree:
  feature_proposed:
    size_assessment:
      small_enhancement:
        action: SKIP Stage 1.5
        reason: Quick win, low risk

      standard_feature:
        competitive_market: "yes"
          action: Quick Mode (parallel)
          reason: Validate competitiveness quickly

        competitive_market: "no"
          action: SKIP Stage 1.5
          reason: Clear market, no competition

      major_feature:
        existing_market: "yes"
          action: Standard Mode (parallel)
          reason: Validate market fit in existing market

        new_market: "yes"
          action: Deep Mode (sequential)
          reason: Full market research before investment

      strategic_initiative:
        action: Deep Mode (sequential)
        reason: Comprehensive analysis needed
```

# 2. Spec - Write spec for dark mode
# 3. Plan - Plan implementation
# 4. Build - Implement dark mode
# 5. Verify - Test dark mode
# 6. Ship - Deploy dark mode

# Stage 1.5 SKIPPED (small enhancement, no market impact)
```

### Example 2: Competitive Feature WITH Market Validation (Parallel)

```bash
"Workflow: new-feature - AI-powered code suggestions"

## Best Practices

### When to Include Market Validation

✅ **INCLUDE Stage 1.5:**
- Features entering competitive markets
- New market entries
- Major strategic features
- Features requiring significant investment
- Features with unclear market demand
- Differentiation-critical features
- Features with strong competitors

❌ **SKIP Stage 1.5:**
- Small enhancements or tweaks
- Internal tools with no market competition
- Technical optimizations
- Clear customer requirements
- Time-critical fixes
- Features with no competitive alternatives

### Execution Modes

**Quick Mode** (Parallel, < 1 hour):
- Use when: Competitive feature check
- Trigger: "How do competitors handle this?"
- Execution: market-intelligence runs parallel with Spec
- Integration: Spec waits for market insights

**Standard Mode** (Parallel, 1-2 hours):
- Use when: New feature in competitive market
- Trigger: "Validate market opportunity for [feature]"
- Execution: market-intelligence runs parallel with Spec
- Integration: Spec incorporates competitive insights

**Deep Mode** (Sequential, 3-4 hours):
- Use when: New market or strategic initiative
- Trigger: "Analyze market for [new market]"
- Execution: market-intelligence runs FIRST, blocks Spec
- Integration: Spec built on complete market analysis

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**
- Add market validation to EVERY feature
- Use deep mode for small features
- Let market analysis block progress on clear wins
- Replace product-manager with market-intelligence
- Use market-intelligence for technical decisions

✅ **DO:**
- Use market validation selectively and strategically
- Match analysis depth to decision importance
- Run parallel when possible to maintain velocity
- Use market insights to inform, not replace, product decisions
- Focus on strategic decisions, not tactical ones

---

## Success Criteria

A successful new feature workflow (with optional market validation):

- [ ] Feature matches spec requirements
- [ ] Market validated OR strategically justified (if Stage 1.5 completed)
- [ ] Competitive differentiation clear (if Stage 1.5 completed)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code is clean and maintainable
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Feature is deployed
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Users can use the feature
- [ ] Monitoring shows healthy state
- [ ] Market feedback positive (if applicable)

---

## Integration Notes

### Agent Collaboration

**market-intelligence collaborates with:**
- **planner**: Provides market data for Spec and Plan stages
- **product-manager**: Provides competitive insights for requirements
- **architect**: Provides market requirements for technical design

**Trigger words for market-intelligence:**
- "Analyze market for..."
- "Compare with competitors..."
- "What's the market demand for..."
- "Should we prioritize feature A or B..."
- "Size the market for..."
- "Assess competitive landscape..."

### Workflow Variants

The new-feature workflow now has three execution paths:

1. **Fast Path** (No market validation)
   - Brainstorm → Spec → Plan → Build → Verify → Ship
   - Use for: Small features, clear requirements, internal tools

2. **Parallel Path** (Quick/Standard market validation)
   - Brainstorm → [Market Val || Spec] → Plan → Build → Verify → Ship
   - Use for: Competitive features, market validation needed

3. **Strategic Path** (Deep market validation)
   - Brainstorm → Market Val → Spec → Plan → Build → Verify → Ship
   - Use for: New markets, strategic initiatives, major investments
