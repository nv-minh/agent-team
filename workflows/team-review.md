# Team Review Workflow

## Overview

The Team Review workflow orchestrates a comprehensive cross-functional review involving multiple specialized agents coordinated by the Team Lead (Orchestrator). This workflow ensures that all aspects of a feature or change are reviewed from business, technical, security, and quality perspectives.

## When to Use

- New feature development before implementation
- Major architectural changes
- Cross-functional impact analysis
- Pre-merge reviews for significant changes
- Post-incident reviews

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Scope Analysis (Team Lead)

**Agent:** `duck:team-lead`

**Actions:**
- Analyze task scope and complexity
- Identify affected components
- Assess risk level
- Select appropriate agents for review

**Output:**
- Task analysis document
- Agent selection list
- Review scope definition

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Scope clearly defined
- [ ] Risk level assessed
- [ ] Required agents identified

---

### Stage 2: Business Validation (Product Manager)

**Agent:** `duck:product`

**Actions:**
- Review specifications from business perspective
- Perform GAP analysis
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Assess business impact and ROI

**Input:** Task description, business requirements

**Output:** Product Manager Review Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Business value validated
- [ ] Market fit assessed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria reviewed
- [ ] No business blockers

---

### Stage 3: Architecture Review (Architect)

**Agent:** `duck:architect`

- [ ] Integration points reviewed

---

### Stage 4: Specialized Reviews (Parallel)

#### 4a: Database Review (if applicable)

**Agent:** `duck:database`

**Actions:**
- Review database schema
- Optimize queries
- Review migration strategy
- Assess data integrity

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Schema design validated
- [ ] Query performance assessed
- [ ] Migration strategy reviewed

#### 4b: Frontend Review (if applicable)

**Agent:** `duck:frontend`

**Actions:**
- Review UI/UX design
- Assess performance (Core Web Vitals)
- Review accessibility compliance
- Evaluate state management

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] UI/UX reviewed
- [ ] Performance analyzed
- [ ] Accessibility audited
- [ ] Responsive design verified

#### 4c: Code Review (if applicable)

**Agent:** `duck:code-review`

**Actions:**
- Perform 9-axis code review
- Classify findings by severity
- Provide quantitative scores
- Generate actionable feedback

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] All 9 axes reviewed
- [ ] Severity table complete
- [ ] Scores calculated
- [ ] Recommendations provided

---

### Stage 5: Security Review (Security Reviewer)

**Agent:** `duck:security`

**Actions:**
- Perform OWASP Top 10 assessment
- Conduct STRIDE threat modeling
- Review code for vulnerabilities
- Exercise blocking authority

**Input:** Code artifacts, architecture diagrams

**Output:** Security Review Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] OWASP assessment complete
- [ ] STRIDE modeling done
- [ ] Blocking issues identified
- [ ] Security scorecard complete

**BLOCKING:** Critical/High security issues MUST be fixed before proceeding

---

### Stage 6: Deep Investigation (if needed)

**Agent:** `duck:staff`

**Actions:**
- Root cause analysis (if issues found)
- Cross-service impact analysis
- Performance deep dive
- Dependency analysis

**Trigger:** Complex issues, architectural concerns, performance problems

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Cross-service impact analyzed
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Recommendations provided

---

### Stage 7: Consolidation (Team Lead)

**Agent:** `duck:team-lead`

**Actions:**
- Collect all agent reports
- Consolidate findings
- Synthesize recommendations
- Make final decision
- Define next steps

**Input:** All agent reports

**Output:** Team Review Report (Consolidated)

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] All reports collected
- [ ] Findings consolidated
- [ ] Decision made
- [ ] Next steps defined

**Completion Marker:** ## ✅ TEAM_LEAD_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE

---

## Revision Loop (max 3 iterations)

To prevent circular dependencies, the workflow includes iteration limits:

- If Product Manager identifies issues requiring Architect revision → Maximum 3 iterations
- If issues persist after 3 iterations → Escalate to Team Lead for final decision
- Team Lead makes binding decision based on all available information

**Revision Process:**
```yaml
iteration_limit: 3
escalation_trigger: "After 3 iterations without resolution"
escalation_target: "Team Lead (duck:team-lead)"
final_authority: "Team Lead decision is binding"
```

## Handoff Contracts

  - task_description
  - business_context
