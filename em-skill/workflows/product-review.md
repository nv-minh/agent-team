# Product Review Workflow

## Overview

The Product Review workflow validates specifications, requirements, and business value from a product perspective while ensuring technical feasibility. It combines the Product Manager's business expertise with the Architect's technical assessment.

## When to Use

- New feature specification review
- Requirements validation
- Product roadmap planning
- Market fit assessment
- Business impact analysis
- Acceptance criteria review

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Business Requirements Review (Product Manager)

**Agent:** `duck:product`

**Actions:**
- Review specifications from business perspective
- Perform GAP analysis (current vs desired state)
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Assess product-market fit
- Calculate ROI and business impact
- Review user stories (INVEST criteria)

**Input:**
- Specification documents
- User stories
- Requirements
- Market context

**Output:** Product Manager Review Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Requirements validated
- [ ] GAP analysis completed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria reviewed
- [ ] Market fit assessed
- [ ] Business value confirmed

---

### Stage 2: Technical Feasibility Review (Architect)

**Agent:** `duck:architect`

**Actions:**
- Assess technical feasibility
- Identify technical options
- Evaluate architectural impact
- Assess development effort
- Identify technical risks
- Review integration requirements

**Input:**
- Product requirements
- Business context
- System architecture

**Output:** Technical Feasibility Assessment

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Options identified
- [ ] Architecture impact assessed
- [ ] Effort estimated
- [ ] Risks identified

---

### Stage 3: Consolidated Product Assessment

**Agents:** `duck:product` + `duck:architect`

**Actions:**
- Merge business and technical findings
- Identify business-technical alignment issues
- Prioritize requirements
- Create actionable recommendations
- Validate product-market fit with technical constraints

**Output:** Consolidated Product Review Report

**Quality Gate:**
