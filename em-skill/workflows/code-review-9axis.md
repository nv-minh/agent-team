# Code Review (9-Axis) Workflow

## Overview

The Code Review (9-Axis) workflow provides comprehensive code quality assessment using the 9-axis review framework. It combines the Senior Code Reviewer's thorough analysis with the Security Reviewer's vulnerability assessment to ensure code is production-ready.

## When to Use

- Pull request reviews
- Pre-merge code quality checks
- Technical debt assessment
- Production readiness evaluation
- Legacy code modernization planning

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: 9-Axis Code Review (Senior Code Reviewer)

**Agent:** `duck:code-review`

**Actions:**
- Perform comprehensive 9-axis review:
  1. **Correctness** - Logic, edge cases, validation
  2. **Readability** - Naming, structure, documentation
  3. **Architecture** - Patterns, separation, modularity
  4. **Security** - Injection, auth, authorization, data protection
  5. **Performance** - Algorithms, caching, database, rendering
  6. **Testing** - Coverage, quality, organization
  7. **Maintainability** - Organization, complexity, duplication
  8. **Scalability** - Horizontal/vertical scaling, data, performance
  9. **Documentation** - Comments, API docs, README

**Input:**
- Code diff / PR
- Commit history
- Related tickets/docs

**Output:** Senior Code Review Report (9-Axis)

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] All 9 axes reviewed
- [ ] Findings classified by severity
- [ ] Scores calculated for each axis
- [ ] Overall score determined

---

### Stage 2: Security Vulnerability Assessment (Security Reviewer)

**Agent:** `duck:security`

**Actions:**
- OWASP Top 10 assessment
- Identify security vulnerabilities in code
- Classify by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Exercise blocking authority for CRITICAL/HIGH issues

**Input:**
- Code artifacts
- Senior code review findings
- Context about system

**Output:** Security Vulnerability Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] OWASP categories assessed
- [ ] Vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Severity classification applied
- [ ] Blocking issues flagged

**BLOCKING:** CRITICAL/HIGH security issues MUST be fixed

---

### Stage 3: Consolidated Code Quality Report

**Agents:** `duck:code-review` + `duck:security`

**Actions:**
- Merge 9-axis and security findings
- Prioritize by combined severity
- Create actionable recommendations
- Make final decision (APPROVED/CONDITIONAL/REJECTED)

**Output:** Consolidated Code Quality Report

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] All findings merged
- [ ] Prioritized by impact
- [ ] Recommendations actionable
- [ ] Decision justified

## 9-Axis Review Framework

### Axis 1: Correctness ✅
**Question:** Does the code do what it's supposed to do?

**Checks:**
- Logic correctness
- Edge cases (null, undefined, empty, boundaries)
- Data validation (input, output, types, constraints)
- Concurrency (race conditions, deadlocks, leaks)

### Axis 2: Readability 📖
**Question:** Is the code easy to understand?

**Checks:**
- Naming (meaningful, descriptive, clear)
- Structure (short functions, minimal nesting, early returns)
- Documentation (complex logic, public APIs, examples)
- Self-documenting (reads like prose, clear intent)

### Axis 3: Architecture 🏗️
**Question:** Does it fit the system architecture?

**Checks:**
- Design patterns (appropriate, correctly applied)
- Separation of concerns (single responsibility, layers)
- Modularity (cohesive, low coupling, clear interfaces)
- Scalability (can handle growth, no hard limits)

### Axis 4: Security 🔒
**Question:** Are there security vulnerabilities?

**Checks:**
- Injection (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal)
- Authentication (passwords, sessions, MFA, rate limiting)
- Authorization (permissions, roles, least privilege)
- Data protection (secrets, encryption, secure comms)

### Axis 5: Performance ⚡
**Question:** Are there performance issues?

**Checks:**
- Algorithms (appropriate complexity, efficient data structures)
- Caching (when appropriate, invalidation strategy)
- Database (indexed queries, optimization, pooling)
- Rendering (avoid re-renders, virtualize lists, lazy loading)

### Axis 6: Testing 🧪
**Question:** Is the code adequately tested?

**Checks:**
- Coverage (unit, integration, e2e)
- Quality (meaningful tests, edge cases, errors)
- Organization (clear structure, descriptive names)
- TDD compliance (tests first, red-green-refactor)

### Axis 7: Maintainability 🔧
**Question:** Is the code easy to maintain?

**Checks:**
- Organization (logical structure, co-located code)
- Complexity (cyclomatic, cognitive, no god functions)
- Duplication (DRY principle, extracted patterns)
- Technical debt (minimal workarounds, proper abstractions)

### Axis 8: Scalability 📈
**Question:** Can the code handle growth?

**Checks:**
- Horizontal scaling (stateless, no shared state)
- Vertical scaling (resource efficient, async operations)
- Data scaling (partitioning, no single points of failure)
- Performance scaling (O(log n) algorithms, batch operations)

### Axis 9: Documentation 📚
**Question:** Is the code well documented?

**Checks:**
- Code comments (complex logic, why not what)
- API documentation (public APIs, parameters, returns)
- README (overview, setup, usage, contribution)
- Inline docs (self-documenting types, JSDoc)
