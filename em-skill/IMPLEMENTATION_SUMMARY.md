## 🎯 Key Features

### Iron Laws
- **TDD Iron Law**: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT FAILING TEST
- **Debugging Iron Law**: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE
- **Skill Iron Law**: ALL SKILLS MUST HAVE FAILING TESTS
- **Spec Iron Law**: NO CODE WITHOUT SPEC (for features)

### Development Lifecycle
```
DEFINE → PLAN → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW → SIMPLIFY → SHIP
```

### Three-Tier Boundary System

#### Always Do
- Run tests before commits
- Follow naming conventions
- Validate inputs
- Write tests for new code
- Review code before shipping

#### Ask First
- Database schema changes
- Adding dependencies
- Changing CI config
- Breaking changes
- Performance optimizations

#### Never Do
- Commit secrets
- Edit vendor directories
- Remove failing tests without approval
- Skip code review
- Push to main without tests

### Special Features
- ✅ Browser automation (headless browser for E2E testing)
- ✅ MCP integrations (GitHub, Context7, Exa, Memory, Playwright)
- ✅ Memory system (learn and remember patterns across sessions)
- ✅ Git hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push for quality gates)
- ✅ CLI commands (quick, debug, review, qa, ship, verify, health, checkpoint)
