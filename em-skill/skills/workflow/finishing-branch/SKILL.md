Before requesting review:

```bash
# ✅ Good: Self-review checklist

# Review changes
git diff main

# Check for issues
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm test

# Check for TODOs or FIXMEs
git diff main | grep -i "TODO\|FIXME"

# Check for console.log
git diff main | grep "console.log"

# Check for debugger
git diff main | grep "debugger"
```

### 2. Request Reviews

```bash
# ✅ Good: Request appropriate reviewers

# Required reviewers
# - Code owner for affected files
# - Team lead for feature changes
# - Security expert for auth changes

# Optional reviewers
# - Team members for awareness
# - Domain experts for complex changes
```

### 3. Address Feedback

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Address review feedback

// Reviewer: "Add validation for email format"
// Before:
function createUser(email: string) {
  return db.users.create({ email });
}

// After:
function createUser(email: string) {
  if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid email format');
  }
  return db.users.create({ email });
}

// Reviewer: "Add test for email validation"
// Added test:
it('should reject invalid email', () => {
  expect(() => createUser('not-an-email')).toThrow(ValidationError);
});
```

## Merge Decisions

### When to Merge

✅ **Merge when:**
- All tests pass
- Code review approved
- Documentation updated
- No unresolved conflicts
- CI/CD pipeline green

❌ **Don't merge when:**
- Tests failing
- Review not approved
- Breaking changes undocumented
- Merge conflicts unresolved
- Performance regression detected

### Merge Methods

#### 1. Merge Commit

```bash
# Use merge commit for preserving history
git checkout main
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin main
```

**When to use:**
- Most feature branches
- When you want to preserve branch history
- When branch has independent history

#### 2. Squash and Merge

```bash
# Squash commits into one
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/my-feature
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git push origin main
```

**When to use:**
- Clean, linear history preferred
- Branch has many small commits
- Feature is self-contained

#### 3. Rebase and Merge

```bash
# Rebase feature branch onto main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin main
```

**When to use:**
- Feature branch is long-lived
- Want to integrate main changes
- Linear history required

## Post-Merge Tasks

### 1. Update Branches

```bash
# ✅ Good: Update other branches

# Update develop branch
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Update other feature branches
git checkout feature/other-feature
git merge main
```

### 2. Delete Branch

```bash
# ✅ Good: Clean up merged branches

# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/my-feature

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/my-feature
```

### 3. Notify Team

```markdown
## Merge Notification

## Merge Conflicts

### Resolving Conflicts

```bash

git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Merge main into feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main

# 3. Resolve conflicts
# Open conflicted files and resolve markers
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Main branch changes
# =======
# Feature branch changes
# >>>>>>> feature/my-feature

# 4. Mark as resolved
git add conflicted-file.ts

# 5. Complete merge
git commit

# 6. Verify everything works
npm test
npm run build
```

### Conflict Prevention

```bash
# ✅ Good: Prevent conflicts

# Keep feature branches short-lived
# Merge main into feature branch regularly
# Communicate with team about work in progress
# Use different files for different features
```
