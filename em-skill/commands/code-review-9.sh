# Code Review (9-Axis) Workflow

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Code:** $CODE_DESCRIPTION

## Review Plan

### Stage 1: 9-Axis Code Review (Senior Code Reviewer)
**Agent:** \`duck:code-review\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: senior-code-reviewer - Perform 9-axis review for: $CODE_DESCRIPTION"

**9 Axes:**
1. **Correctness** ✅ - Logic, edge cases, validation, concurrency
2. **Readability** 📖 - Naming, structure, documentation
3. **Architecture** 🏗️ - Patterns, separation, modularity, scalability
4. **Security** 🔒 - Injection, auth, authorization, data protection
5. **Performance** ⚡ - Algorithms, caching, database, rendering
6. **Testing** 🧪 - Coverage, quality, organization, TDD
7. **Maintainability** 🔧 - Organization, complexity, duplication
8. **Scalability** 📈 - Horizontal/vertical scaling, data, performance
9. **Documentation** 📚 - Comments, API docs, README

### Stage 2: Security Vulnerability Assessment (Security Reviewer)
**Agent:** \`duck:security\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: security-reviewer - Perform security assessment for: $CODE_DESCRIPTION"

**Assessment:**
- OWASP Top 10 categories
- Vulnerability identification
- Severity classification (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **BLOCKING authority** for CRITICAL/HIGH issues

### Stage 3: Consolidated Code Quality Report
**Agents:** \`duck:code-review\` + \`duck:security\`

**Output:**
- Merged 9-axis and security findings
- Prioritized by combined severity
- Actionable recommendations
- Final decision (APPROVED/CONDITIONAL/REJECTED)

## 9-Axis Review Framework

### Correctness
- Logic correctness
- Edge cases (null, undefined, empty, boundaries)
- Data validation
- Concurrency (race conditions, deadlocks)

### Readability
- Meaningful naming
- Clear structure
- Self-documenting code
- Appropriate comments

### Architecture
- Design patterns
- Separation of concerns
- Modularity
- Scalability

### Security
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization
- Data protection
- Secrets management

### Performance
- Algorithm complexity
- Caching strategy
- Database optimization
- Rendering optimization

### Testing
- Test coverage
- Test quality
- Edge case coverage
- TDD compliance

### Maintainability
- Code organization
- Complexity management
- DRY principle
- Technical debt

### Scalability
- Stateless design
- Resource efficiency
- Data partitioning
- Async processing

### Documentation
- Code comments
- API documentation
- README completeness
- Inline docs

## Severity Classification

### Critical (BLOCKS Deployment)
- Security vulnerability
- Data loss risk
- Production outage risk
- Legal compliance issue

### High (BLOCKS Merge)
- Bug affecting users
- Performance regression
- Accessibility violation
- Test coverage below threshold

### Medium (Fix Before Next Release)
- Code smell
- Minor performance issue
- Missing documentation
- Technical debt

### Low (Nice to Have)
- Style inconsistency
- Naming suggestion
- Optimization opportunity

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All 9 axes reviewed and scored
- [ ] Security assessment completed
- [ ] Findings classified by severity
- [ ] Overall score calculated
- [ ] Blocking issues identified
- [ ] Recommendations prioritized
- [ ] Decision documented

## Output

Consolidated Code Quality Report with:
- Executive Summary
- 9-Axis detailed review
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Severity table
- Scorecard
- Recommendations
- Decision (APPROVED/CONDITIONAL/REJECTED)

**Note:** CRITICAL/HIGH security issues MUST be fixed before proceeding
