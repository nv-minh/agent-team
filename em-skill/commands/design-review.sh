- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA)
- Performance optimization

### Stage 3: Consolidated Design Assessment
**Agents:** \`duck:product\` + \`duck:frontend\`

## UI/UX Review Framework

### Visual Design
- Color (contrast, palette, brand alignment)

### User Experience
- Navigation (intuitive, structure, breadcrumbs)
- Flows (smooth, edge cases, error states)
- Feedback (loading, progress, errors, confirmations)
