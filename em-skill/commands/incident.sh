# Incident Response Workflow

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Incident:** $INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION

## Response Plan

### Stage 1: Initial Assessment & Triage (Staff Engineer)
**Agent:** \`duck:staff\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: staff-engineer - Assess incident: $INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION"

**Actions:**
- Assess incident severity (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Understand incident scope
- Identify affected services/users
- Begin timeline reconstruction
- Gather initial data

**Severity Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Complete outage, data loss, security breach, revenue >$10K/hour
- **P1 (High):** Significant degradation, major feature broken, revenue >$1K/hour
- **P2 (Medium):** Minor degradation, single feature broken
- **P3 (Low):** Cosmetic issue, no user impact

### Stage 2: Security Investigation (if applicable)
**Agent:** \`duck:security\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: security-reviewer - Investigate security incident: $INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION"

**Actions:**
- Check for security breach
- Assess if incident is security-related
- Review audit logs
- Check for unauthorized access
- Assess data exposure

### Stage 3: Root Cause Analysis (Staff Engineer)
**Agent:** \`duck:staff\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: staff-engineer - Root cause analysis for: $INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION"

**Actions:**
- Apply 5 Whys methodology
- Create fishbone diagram
- Reconstruct complete timeline
- Identify contributing factors
- Determine root cause

### Stage 4: Cross-Service Impact Analysis (Staff Engineer)
**Agent:** \`duck:staff\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: staff-engineer - Cross-service impact analysis for: $INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION"

**Actions:**
- Map affected services
- Analyze dependency impact
- Assess data integrity
- Identify cascade effects
- Document user impact

### Stage 5: Resolution & Verification (Staff Engineer + Security Reviewer)
**Agents:** \`duck:staff\` + \`duck:security\`

**Actions:**
- Implement fixes
- Verify resolution
- Assess if security patches needed
- Document temporary workarounds
- Plan permanent fixes

### Stage 6: Postmortem & Prevention (Staff Engineer + Security Reviewer)
**Agents:** \`duck:staff\` + \`duck:security\`

**Actions:**
- Create blameless postmortem
- Identify lessons learned
- Create action items with owners
- Update runbooks
- Improve monitoring/alerting

## Root Cause Analysis Framework

### 5 Whys Method
Iteratively ask "why" to drill down to root cause

### Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram
Categories: People, Process, Technology, Environment, Data, Management

## Blameless Postmortem Principles

- Focus on systems, not people
- Assume good intent
- Psychological safety
- Learning over blame

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Severity assessed accurately
- [ ] Timeline reconstructed completely
- [ ] Root cause identified and validated
- [ ] Cross-service impact analyzed
- [ ] Security investigation completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Issue resolved and verified
- [ ] Blameless postmortem completed
- [ ] Action items created with owners
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Prevention measures defined
- [ ] Follow-up scheduled

## Output

Incident Response Report with:
- Executive Summary
- Timeline
- Initial Assessment
- Security Investigation (if applicable)
- Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys, contributing factors)
- Cross-Service Impact
- Resolution (immediate actions, workarounds, permanent fix)
- Postmortem (what went well, improvements, action items)
- Lessons Learned
- Follow-up Plan
