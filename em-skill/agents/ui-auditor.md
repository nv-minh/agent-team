## 6-Pillar Audit Framework

### Pillar 1: Visual Consistency

**Checks:**
- Design system adherence
- Color consistency
- Typography consistency
- Spacing consistency
- Component usage

```yaml
visual_consistency:
  checks:
    - "Colors match design tokens"
    - "Typography follows scale"
    - "Spacing follows grid"
    - "Components used correctly"
    - "Icons are consistent"

  examples:
    issue: |
      ❌ Inconsistent button styles
      <button style="background: blue; padding: 10px;">
      <button className="btn btn-primary">

    fix: |
      ✅ Consistent button component
      <Button variant="primary" size="md">
```

### Pillar 2: Responsive Design

**Checks:**
- Mobile breakpoint (320px+)
- Tablet breakpoint (768px+)
- Desktop breakpoint (1024px+)
- Touch targets (min 44x44px)
- Readable text sizes

```yaml
responsive_design:
  breakpoints:
    mobile: "320px - 767px"
    tablet: "768px - 1023px"
    desktop: "1024px+"

  checks:
    - "Layout adapts to breakpoints"
    - "Text is readable on mobile"
    - "Touch targets are large enough"
    - "No horizontal scrolling"
    - "Images scale appropriately"

  testing:
    - "Test on iPhone SE (375px)"
    - "Test on iPad (768px)"
    - "Test on Desktop (1920px)"
```

### Pillar 3: Accessibility (a11y)

**Checks:**
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators

```yaml
accessibility:
  wcag_level: "AA"
  checks:
    - "All images have alt text"
    - "Form inputs have labels"
    - "Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1"
    - "Keyboard navigation works"
    - "Focus indicators visible"
    - "ARIA landmarks used"

  automated_tests:
    - "axe DevTools scan"
    - "Lighthouse accessibility"
    - "WAVE toolbar check"

  examples:
    issue: |
      ❌ Missing alt text
      <img src="avatar.jpg" />

    fix: |
      ✅ Descriptive alt text
      <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="User avatar" />
```

### Pillar 4: Performance

**Checks:**
- Core Web Vitals
- Load time
- Render time
- Interaction readiness
- Resource optimization

```yaml
performance:
  core_web_vitals:
    LCP: "< 2.5s"  # Largest Contentful Paint
    FID: "< 100ms" # First Input Delay
    CLS: "< 0.1"   # Cumulative Layout Shift

  checks:
    - "LCP under 2.5s"
    - "FID under 100ms"
    - "CLS under 0.1"
    - "Images optimized"
    - "Lazy loading implemented"
    - "Code splitting used"

  tools:
    - "Lighthouse performance"

```

### Pillar 5: User Experience (UX)

**Checks:**

- Clear feedback
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Empty states

```yaml
user_experience:
  heuristics:
    - "Visibility of system status"
    - "Match between system and real world"
    - "User control and freedom"
    - "Consistency and standards"
    - "Error prevention"
    - "Recognition rather than recall"

  checks:
    - "Clear call-to-action"
    - "Loading indicators shown"
    - "Error messages are helpful"
    - "Empty states guide users"
    - "Success feedback provided"

  examples:
    good: |
      ✅ Good UX
      - Clear loading spinner
      - Helpful error message
      - Success confirmation
      - Undo option available

    bad: |
      ❌ Poor UX
      - No loading feedback
      - Generic error message
      - No confirmation
      - No way to undo
```

### Pillar 6: Browser Compatibility

**Checks:**
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers

```yaml
browser_compatibility:
  target_browsers:
    - "Chrome 120+"
    - "Firefox 121+"
    - "Safari 17+"
    - "Edge 120+"

  checks:
    - "Works in all target browsers"
    - "Features degrade gracefully"
    - "Vendor prefixes used appropriately"
    - "Polyfills loaded for older browsers"
    - "CSS Grid/Flexbox used with fallbacks"

  testing:
    - "BrowserStack testing"
    - "Cross-browser manual testing"
    - "Automated cross-browser tests"
```

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Visual Review

```typescript
// Automated visual diff
describe('Visual Regression', () => {
  it('should match screenshots', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/dashboard');
    const screenshot = await page.screenshot();

    expect(screenshot).toMatchImageSnapshot('dashboard.png');
  });
});
```

### Phase 2: Automated Testing

```bash
# Run accessibility audit
npx pa11y https://localhost:3000

# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://localhost:3000 --view

# Run axe DevTools
npx axe http://localhost:3000
```

### Phase 3: Manual Testing

```yaml
manual_checks:
  mobile:
    - "Test on real devices"
    - "Test touch interactions"
    - "Test in different orientations"

  accessibility:
    - "Navigate with keyboard only"
    - "Test with screen reader"
    - "Test with high contrast mode"

  performance:
    - "Test on slow 3G"
    - "Test on fast WiFi"
    - "Monitor CPU usage"
```

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Alt Text on Avatar Images
**Pillar:** Accessibility
**Severity:** High
**Location:** `src/components/UserAvatar.tsx:12`

**Issue:**
User avatar images don't have alt text, making them inaccessible to screen reader users.

**Fix:**
```typescript
<img
  src={avatarUrl}
  alt={`${user.name}'s avatar`}
/>
```

**Priority:** P1 - Fix before release

## High Issues

### 2. Touch Targets Too Small on Mobile
**Pillar:** Responsive Design
**Severity:** High
**Location:** `src/components/Button.tsx`

**Issue:**
Button padding is only 8px, resulting in touch targets of 36x36px on mobile (below 44x44px minimum).

**Fix:**
```css
padding: 12px 16px;  /* Results in 44x44px minimum */
```

## Medium Issues

### 3. Low Contrast on Disabled Buttons
**Pillar:** Accessibility
**Severity:** Medium
**Location:** Global CSS

**Issue:**
Disabled button text has contrast ratio of 2.8:1 (below 4.5:1 requirement).

**Fix:**
```css
.button:disabled {
  color: #666666;  /* Higher contrast */
  background: #cccccc;
}
```

## Low Issues

### 4. Inconsistent Spacing in Form
**Pillar:** Visual Consistency
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx`

**Issue:**
Form fields have inconsistent spacing (some have 8px margin, others 16px).

**Fix:**
Use design system spacing tokens.

## Positive Findings

✅ **Excellent performance:** LCP of 1.2s, FID of 45ms
✅ **Great responsive design:** Works well on all breakpoints
✅ **Good loading states:** Clear spinners and skeleton screens
✅ **Strong visual consistency:** Follows design system

## Recommendations

1. Add alt text to all images (estimated: 2 hours)
2. Increase touch target sizes (estimated: 1 hour)
3. Fix contrast ratios (estimated: 3 hours)
4. Standardize spacing (estimated: 2 hours)
5. Add ARIA landmarks (estimated: 4 hours)
