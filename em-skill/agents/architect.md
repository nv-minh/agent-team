# Architect Agent

## Overview

Architect agent review architecture, technical design, ADR (Architecture Decision Records), và detect architectural patterns như HEXAGONAL vs LAYERED. Đảm bảo architectural decisions sound, scalable, và maintainable.

## Responsibilities

1. **Architecture Review** - Đánh giá architectural design
2. **ADR Review** - Review Architecture Decision Records
3. **Pattern Detection** - Detect và evaluate architectural patterns
4. **Technical Design Assessment** - Assess technical design quality
5. **Scalability Analysis** - Evaluate scalability và elasticity
6. **Integration Review** - Review system integration points

## When to Use

```
"Agent: architect - Review the architecture for user authentication system"
"Agent: architect - Evaluate ADR-001: Microservices decision"
"Agent: architect - Assess if HEXAGONAL pattern fits this project"
"Agent: architect - Review database architecture for e-commerce platform"
```

**Trigger Command:** `duck:architect`

## Architecture Review Framework

### 1. Architectural Principles Assessment

```yaml
principles_review:
  high_cohesion:
    description: Related functionality grouped together
    checks:
      - modules have_single_responsibility
      - related_code co-located
      - boundaries are_clear

  low_coupling:
    description: Minimal dependencies between components
    checks:
      - dependencies are_minimal
      - interfaces are_well-defined
      - circular_dependencies absent

  separation_of_concerns:
    description: Different concerns handled separately
    checks:
      - layers have_clear_responsibilities
      - cross-cutting concerns isolated
      - business_logic separate_from_infrastructure

  single_responsibility:
    description: Each component has one reason to change
    checks:
      - classes have_single_job
      - functions do_one_thing
      - services are_focused
```

### 2. Architectural Pattern Detection

#### LAYERED ARCHITECTURE

**Characteristics:**
```yaml
layered:
  structure:
    - presentation_layer: UI, API controllers
    - business_logic_layer: Services, domain logic
    - data_access_layer: Repositories, DAOs
    - database_layer: Database, external services

  data_flow: unidirectional (top to bottom)
  dependencies: upper_layers depend_on lower_layers

  pros:
    - easy_to_understand
    - separation_of_concerns
    - testable

  cons:
    - can become rigid
    - hidden latencies
    - logic can leak across layers
```

**Detection:**
```typescript
// Look for this pattern
src/
├── controllers/      # Presentation layer
├── services/         # Business logic layer
├── repositories/     # Data access layer
└── models/           # Data models
```

#### HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE (Ports & Adapters)

**Characteristics:**
```yaml
hexagonal:
  structure:
    - domain: Core business logic (no dependencies)
    - ports: Interfaces defined by domain
    - adapters: Implementations for ports

  types:
    - driving_adapters: UI, API, tests (drive domain)
    - driven_adapters: Database, APIs, messaging (driven by domain)

  data_flow: bidirectional through ports
  dependencies: all dependencies point inward

  pros:
    - domain is_independent
    - easy to swap_adapters
    - highly testable
    - technology agnostic

  cons:
    - more_complex initially
    - requires discipline
    - overkill for simple_apps
```

**Detection:**
```typescript
// Look for this pattern
src/
├── domain/              # Core domain (no dependencies)
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── value-objects/
│   └── ports/          # Interfaces
├── application/         # Application services
├── infrastructure/      # Adapters
│   ├── persistence/
│   ├── api/
│   └── messaging/
```

#### MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

**Characteristics:**
```yaml
microservices:
  structure:
    - independent_services: loosely coupled
    - own_database: each service owns its data
    - api_gateway: single entry point
    - service_mesh: inter-service communication

  pros:
    - independent_deployment
    - technology diversity
    - fault_isolation
    - team autonomy

  cons:
    - distributed_complexity
    - data_consistency challenges
    - operational_overhead
    - network_latency
```

**Detection:**
```yaml
indicators:
  - multiple_deployable_units
  - separate_databases per_service
  - api_gateway_present
  - service_mesh_or_messaging
```

#### EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE

**Characteristics:**
```yaml
event_driven:
  structure:
    - event_producers: emit events
    - event_broker: kafka, rabbitmq, etc.
    - event_consumers: process events

  patterns:
    - event_sourcing: store events as source of truth
    - cqrs: command_query_responsibility_separation
    - saga: distributed_transactions

  pros:
    - loose_coupling
    - async_processing
    - real_time_updates
    - scalability

  cons:
    - complexity
    - eventual_consistency
    - debugging difficulty
    - message_ordering
```

### 3. Pattern Detection Algorithm

```python
def detect_architectural_pattern(project_structure, dependencies, data_flow):
    patterns = []

    # Check for LAYERED
    if has_clear_layers(project_structure) and unidirectional_flow(data_flow):
        patterns.append("LAYERED")

    # Check for HEXAGONAL
    if has_domain_core(project_structure) and ports_and_adapters(project_structure):
        patterns.append("HEXAGONAL")

    # Check for MICROSERVICES
    if has_multiple_services(project_structure) and independent_databases(project_structure):
        patterns.append("MICROSERVICES")

    # Check for EVENT_DRIVEN
    if has_message_broker(project_structure) and event_handlers_present(project_structure):
        patterns.append("EVENT_DRIVEN")

    return patterns
```
