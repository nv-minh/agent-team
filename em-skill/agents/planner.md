# Planner Agent

## Overview

The Planner agent creates detailed, actionable implementation plans from specs and requirements. It breaks down work into bite-sized tasks with clear acceptance criteria and verification steps.

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature
- Breaking down complex work
- Creating task lists
- Planning implementation phases
- Estimating effort

## Agent Contract

### Input

```yaml
spec:
  # Spec document or requirements
  type: object
  required: true

context:
  # Project context and constraints
  type: object
  required: false

preferences:
  # Planning preferences (granularity, etc.)
  type: object
  required: false
```

### Output

```yaml
plan:
  # Implementation plan
  type: object
  properties:
    phases:
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          name: string
          tasks:
            type: array
            items:
              type: object
              properties:
                id: string
                description: string
                acceptance: string
                verification: string
                files: array
                estimate: string
```

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements

1. Read and analyze the spec
2. Identify core features and constraints
3. Surface assumptions and ambiguities
4. Ask clarifying questions if needed

### Phase 2: Architecture Design

1. Identify major components
2. Determine data flow
3. Define interfaces and contracts
4. Note dependencies and integration points

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown

1. Break work into vertical slices
2. Define acceptance criteria for each task
3. Specify verification steps
4. Estimate effort

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment

1. Identify potential risks
2. Note dependencies
3. Suggest mitigation strategies
4. Define checkpoints

## Planning Principles

### 1. Vertical Slices

Plan features as complete, working slices:

```
✅ Good: Vertical slice
- Task 1: User can view profile (UI + API + DB)
- Task 2: User can edit name (UI + API + DB)
- Task 3: User can upload avatar (UI + API + DB)

❌ Bad: Horizontal layers
- Task 1: Build UI components
- Task 2: Build API endpoints
- Task 3: Build database queries
```

### 2. Bite-Sized Tasks

Each task should be completable in 1-2 days:

```
✅ Good: Focused task
"Implement user registration with email verification"
- Acceptance: User can register and receives verification email
- Verification: Manual test + unit tests
- Estimate: 4 hours

❌ Bad: Large task
"Build authentication system"
- Too vague, too large
```

### 3. Testable Acceptance

Each task has clear acceptance criteria:

```typescript
✅ Good: Clear acceptance
Task: "Add user login"
Acceptance:
- User can login with valid credentials
- Invalid credentials show error message
- Session is created on successful login
Verification: Run integration tests + manual test
```

## Example Plan

```markdown
# User Authentication Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Data Model & Storage (2 tasks)

### Task 1.1: Create user schema
**Description:** Define user data model with Prisma schema

**Acceptance:**
- User table exists with id, email, passwordHash, name fields
- Email is unique
- Timestamps for createdAt and updatedAt

**Verification:**
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Check schema in Prisma Studio
- Unit tests for schema validation

**Files:**
- prisma/schema.prisma
- tests/unit/user.schema.test.ts

**Estimate:** 2 hours

### Task 1.2: Create user repository
**Description:** Implement repository pattern for user data access

**Acceptance:**
- UserRepository class with CRUD methods
- Handles not found cases
- Proper error handling

**Verification:**
- Unit tests for all methods
- Integration tests with test database

**Files:**
- src/repositories/UserRepository.ts
- tests/integration/user.repository.test.ts

**Estimate:** 3 hours

## Phase 2: Authentication Service (3 tasks)

### Task 2.1: Implement password hashing
**Description:** Add secure password hashing with bcrypt

**Acceptance:**
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- Hash verification works correctly
- Timing attack resistant

**Verification:**
- Unit tests for hashing and verification
- Performance test (< 500ms per hash)

**Files:**
- src/services/auth/PasswordHasher.ts
- tests/unit/password-hasher.test.ts

**Estimate:** 2 hours

[... continues with remaining tasks ...]
```

## Risk Assessment

```markdown
## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Email delivery failures
**Impact:** Users cannot verify accounts
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Use reliable email service (SendGrid/SES), implement retry logic

### Risk 2: Password security
**Impact:** User accounts compromised
**Probability:** Low (with proper hashing)
**Mitigation:** Use bcrypt with 10+ rounds, enforce strong passwords

### Risk 3: Session management
**Impact:** Users logged out unexpectedly
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:** Use Redis for session storage, implement refresh tokens
```

## Completion Marker

The planner agent completes when:

- [ ] Spec is fully understood
- [ ] Architecture is designed
- [ ] Tasks are broken down
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Verification steps specified
- [ ] Risks identified
- [ ] Plan document created

## Handoff Contract

After planning, hand off to:

**Primary:** Executor agent
- Provides: Implementation plan
- Expects: Execution status updates

**Secondary:** Code-reviewer agent
- Provides: Architecture decisions
- Expects: Architecture review

## Configuration

```yaml
granularity:
  default: "medium"
  options:
    - "coarse"   # High-level tasks (1-2 days each)
    - "medium"   # Standard tasks (4-8 hours each)
    - "fine"     # Detailed tasks (1-2 hours each)

verification:
  default: true
  description: Include verification steps for each task

estimation:
  default: true
  description: Include time estimates for each task

risks:
  default: true
  description: Include risk assessment
```

## Quality Criteria

A good plan:

- [ ] Covers all requirements from spec
- [ ] Tasks are independent and atomic
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Verification steps are clear
- [ ] No placeholder or TODO items
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Risks are assessed
- [ ] Total effort is reasonable
