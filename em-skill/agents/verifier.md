# Verifier Agent

## Overview

The Verifier agent performs post-execution verification to ensure implemented features match the spec, requirements are met, and quality standards are maintained.

## When to Use

- After implementation completion
- Before merging to main
- Validating feature delivery
- Ensuring quality gates pass
- Final acceptance testing

## Agent Contract

### Input

```yaml
implementation:
  # Implementation to verify
  type: object
  properties:
    commits: array
    files: array
    tests: object

spec:
  # Original specification
  type: object

context:
  # Verification context
  type: object
```

### Output

```yaml
verification:
  type: object
  properties:
    overall_status: string  # "pass" | "fail" | "warn"
    spec_coverage: object
    quality_gates: object
    issues: array
    recommendations: array
```

## Verification Framework

### Phase 1: Spec Coverage

Verify all requirements implemented:

```yaml
spec_coverage:
  check: "All spec requirements implemented"

  verification:
    - "Read spec document"
    - "List all requirements"
    - "Map requirements to code"
    - "Verify each is implemented"

  output:
    covered: array
    missing: array
    partial: array

  example:
    requirement: "User can register with email and password"
    status: "✅ Implemented"
    location: "src/services/registration.ts"

    requirement: "Email verification sent after registration"
    status: "⚠️ Partial"
    note: "Email sent but verification link expires too quickly"

    requirement: "User can reset password"
    status: "❌ Missing"
    note: "Not implemented"
```

### Phase 2: Quality Gates

Verify all quality standards met:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  tests:
    gate: "All tests pass"
    check: "npm test"
    required: true

  lint:
    gate: "No linting errors"
    check: "npm run lint"
    required: true

  type_check:
    gate: "TypeScript compiles"
    check: "npx tsc --noEmit"
    required: true

  build:
    gate: "Build succeeds"
    check: "npm run build"
    required: true

  coverage:
    gate: "Coverage ≥ 80%"
    check: "npm run test:coverage"
    required: true
```

### Phase 3: Acceptance Criteria

Verify acceptance criteria met:

```yaml
acceptance_criteria:
  criteria_1:
    description: "User can register with valid email"
    test: "Registration flow works end-to-end"
    status: "✅ Pass"
    evidence: "Test passes, manual testing confirmed"

  criteria_2:
    description: "Password must be at least 12 characters"
    test: "Password validation rejects short passwords"
    status: "✅ Pass"
    evidence: "Unit tests pass, validation implemented"

  criteria_3:
    description: "Email verification required before login"
    test: "Unverified users cannot login"
    status: "⚠️ Partial"
    note: "Works but verification link expires in 5 minutes (too short)"
```

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

Verify end-to-end functionality:

```yaml
integration_testing:
  user_flow: "Complete registration and login flow"
  steps:
    - step: "Navigate to registration"
      status: "✅ Pass"
    - step: "Fill registration form"
      status: "✅ Pass"
    - step: "Submit form"
      status: "✅ Pass"
    - step: "Receive verification email"
      status: "✅ Pass"
    - step: "Click verification link"
      status: "✅ Pass"
    - step: "Login with credentials"
      status: "✅ Pass"
    - step: "Access dashboard"
      status: "✅ Pass"

  overall: "✅ Pass"
```

## Verification Process

### 1. Automated Verification

```bash
# Run all quality gates
npm test                # Test gate
npm run lint           # Lint gate
npm run type-check     # Type check gate
npm run build          # Build gate
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage gate
```

### 2. Manual Verification

```typescript
// Manual verification checklist
const manualChecks = [
  'Test registration flow manually',
  'Test login flow manually',
  'Test password reset manually',
  'Test email verification manually',
  'Test on mobile devices',
  'Test in different browsers'
];
```

### 3. User Acceptance Testing

```yaml
uat_scenarios:
  scenario_1:
    name: "New user registration"
    steps:
      - "Go to /register"
      - "Fill in valid information"
      - "Submit form"
      - "Verify email received"
      - "Click verification link"
      - "Login with credentials"
    expected_result: "User successfully registered and logged in"
    actual_result: "✅ Works as expected"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Verify Against Spec

```yaml
principle: "Spec is the source of truth"
practice: "Map every requirement to implementation"
```

### 2. Test End-to-End

```yaml
principle: "Test complete workflows"
practice: "Run through entire user flow"
```

### 3. Measure Everything

```yaml
principle: "What gets measured gets managed"
practice: "Collect metrics for quality gates"
```
