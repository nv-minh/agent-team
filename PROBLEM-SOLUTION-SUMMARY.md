# EM-Skill Discovery Issue - Problem & Solution

**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

### User Reported Issue
When working in a **different repository** (not EM-Skill repo), user asked:
> "Đã install bộ em-skill chưa?"

### Claude's Response (Before Fix)
```
⏺ Không thấy skill nào tên "em-skill" trong danh sách skill có sẵn hiện tại.
Bạn có thể:
  1. Chỉ ra đường dẫn hoặc file skill muốn cài
  2. Nói rõ "em-skill" là bộ skill gì (tên repo, nguồn)
  3. Hoặc để tôi kiểm tra thư mục .claude/skills/ xem có skill custom nào không
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **EM-Skill is NOT a single skill**
   - EM-Skill is a complete system with 25+ skills, 16 agents, 18 workflows
   - Skills are organized in subdirectories (foundation/, development/, quality/, workflow/)
   - No single file named "em-skill.md" or similar

2. **Missing discovery mechanism**
   - Claude Code CLI was configured with correct paths
   - But no index file for Claude to reference
   - No manifest file to describe the system

3. **Documentation scattered**
   - README.md at root level
   - Docs in docs/ directory
   - No quick reference in skills/ directory itself

## ✅ Solution Implemented

- Quick reference section
- Links to documentation

**Size:** ~300 lines
**Format:** Markdown with clear sections

### 2. Created skills/README.md
**Location:** `/Users/abc/Desktop/EM-Skill/skills/README.md`

**Purpose:** Quick reference for EM-Skill

**Contents:**
- Quick start guide
- Summary of available resources
- Link to complete SKILL-INDEX.md
- Installation status

**Size:** ~50 lines

### 3. Updated ~/.claude/config.json
**Location:** `~/.claude/config.json`

**Changes:**
```json
{
  "skills": {
    "enabled": true,
    "paths": ["/Users/abc/Desktop/EM-Skill/skills"],
    "description": "EM-Skill - Fullstack Engineering System with 25+ skills...
                    See: /Users/abc/Desktop/EM-Skill/skills/SKILL-INDEX.md"
  },
  "agents": {
    "enabled": true,
    "paths": ["/Users/abc/Desktop/EM-Skill/agents"],
    "description": "EM-Skill Agents - 16 specialized agents...

    "enabled": true,
    "paths": ["/Users/abc/Desktop/EM-Skill/workflows"],

                    See: /Users/abc/Desktop/EM-Skill/skills/SKILL-INDEX.md"
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** Claude can now read descriptions and find SKILL-INDEX.md

### 4. Created INSTALLATION-VERIFICATION.md
