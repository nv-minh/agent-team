## Using Agents

### What are Agents?

Agents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each agent has expertise in a particular domain.

### Core Agents

#### 1. Planner Agent
**Purpose:** Create detailed implementation plans
**Usage:** `Agent: planner - Create implementation plan for feature X`
**Best for:** Breaking down complex features

#### 2. Executor Agent
**Purpose:** Execute plans with atomic commits
**Usage:** `Agent: executor - Implement the authentication plan`
**Best for:** Implementation with version control

#### 3. Code-Reviewer Agent
**Purpose:** 5-axis code review
**Usage:** `Agent: code-reviewer - Review the changes in this PR`
**Best for:** Quality assurance

#### 4. Debugger Agent
**Purpose:** Systematic debugging
**Usage:** `Agent: debugger - Investigate this bug systematically`
**Best for:** Root cause analysis

#### 5. Test-Engineer Agent
**Purpose:** Test strategy and generation

## Distributed Mode

### What is Distributed Mode?

Distributed mode runs multiple specialist agents in parallel in isolated tmux sessions to solve token context overflow and enable parallel processing.

### When to Use Distributed Mode

✅ **Use when:**
- Task requires analysis across multiple domains
- Need specialist expertise from different areas
- Context is approaching token limits
- Need comprehensive audit trail
- Want parallel execution for speed

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Task is simple and single-domain
- Quick investigation needed
- Don't need parallel processing

### Starting Distributed Mode

```bash
# Start distributed orchestration
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh start

# This creates:
# - tmux session: claude-work
# - Windows: orchestrator, backend, frontend, database
# - Directories: reports/, queue/, logs/

# Attach to orchestrator window
tmux attach -t claude-work:orchestrator

# Trigger investigation
"Agent: techlead-orchestrator - Investigate authentication bug"

# The orchestrator will:
# 1. Analyze the task
# 2. Delegate to specialist agents
# 3. Collect findings
# 4. Consolidate into report
```

### Managing Distributed Sessions

```bash
# List active sessions
./scripts/session-manager.sh list

# Check agent status
./distributed/session-coordinator.sh agent-status

# Check queue status
./distributed/session-coordinator.sh queue-status

# Broadcast message to all agents
./scripts/session-manager.sh broadcast "echo 'Status update'"

# Consolidate reports
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh consolidate

# Stop distributed mode
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh stop
```

### Viewing Reports

```bash
# List available reports
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh list

# View consolidated report
cat /tmp/claude-work-reports/techlead/consolidated-report.md

# View individual agent reports
ls /tmp/claude-work-reports/backend/
ls /tmp/claude-work-reports/frontend/
ls /tmp/claude-work-reports/database/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Tool

```bash
# Simple task → Use skill
"Use the brainstorming skill to explore feature ideas"

# Specialized task → Use agent
"Agent: code-reviewer - Review this PR"

# Complex process → Use workflow
"Workflow: new-feature - Build and ship the feature"

# Multi-domain task → Use distributed mode
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh start
```

### 2. Be Specific with Prompts

```bash
# ❌ Too vague
"Agent: planner - Plan something"

# ✅ Specific and clear
"Agent: planner - Create implementation plan for JWT-based user authentication with refresh tokens, including database schema, API endpoints, and frontend components"
```

### 3. Provide Context

```bash
# ❌ No context
"Agent: debugger - Fix this bug"

# ✅ With context
"Agent: debugger - Investigate login timeout bug. Started occurring after deployment 2 hours ago. Error: 'Connection timeout after 30s'. Affects 10% of login attempts. Backend logs show database query timeouts."
```

### 4. Follow Iron Laws

```bash
# TDD Iron Law
# NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT FAILING TEST

# Debugging Iron Law
# NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE

# Spec Iron Law
# NO CODE WITHOUT SPEC (for features)
```

### 5. Review and Iterate

```bash
# Always review agent outputs
"Agent: code-reviewer - Review the implementation"

# Iterate based on feedback
# Make improvements
# Re-verify
```

# Step 5: Verify fix
"Agent: test-engineer - Verify the login timeout fix"

# Step 6: Postmortem
"Workflow: incident-response - Create postmortem for login timeout incident"
```

### Example 3: Performance Optimization
