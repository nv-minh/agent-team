# Skill Systems Guide

## Overview

EM-Team provides a unified skill system containing **74 skills** across **21 category directories**. Skills are the building blocks that give agents and workflows their domain expertise -- covering everything from foundational development practices to language-specific patterns, quality assurance, and workflow automation.

Each skill is a self-contained Markdown file with YAML frontmatter metadata and structured body sections. Skills are installed globally via `bash install.sh`, which creates symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` so they are available in any Claude Code project.

**Version:** 3.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-07

### Directory Naming Convention

- **`foundation/`** and **`development/`** -- process-oriented skills that apply to any tech stack
- **`expert-*/`** -- technology-specific skills grouped by domain (react, vue, database, devops, etc.)
- **`quality/`** -- verification, testing, and audit skills
- **`workflow/`** -- automation, git, and communication skills
- **`additional/`** -- product discovery and business analysis skills

## Skill Format

Each skill consists of two files in its category subdirectory:

```
skills/{category}/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md           # Symlink to the source .md file
└── {skill-name}.md    # Source file with full content
```

### Source File Structure

Every source `.md` file follows this format:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: "Short description of when and why to use this skill"
version: "2.0.0"
category: "foundation"
origin: "superpowers"
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob]
triggers:
  - "trigger phrase"
  - "another trigger"
intent: "What this skill aims to accomplish"
scenarios:
  - "Scenario where this skill applies"
best_for: "Primary use case summary"
estimated_time: "15-60 min"
anti_patterns:
  - "Common misuse to avoid"
related_skills: [other-skill, another-skill]

## How Skills Are Discovered

### Installation

Running `bash install.sh` from the EM-Team root performs three steps:

1. **Configures `~/.claude/config.json`** -- sets the skills path to the EM-Team repo
2. **Creates wrapper symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/`** -- each skill gets a directory like `~/.claude/skills/em:skill:brainstorming/SKILL.md`
3. **Cleans up orphaned entries** -- removes broken or outdated symlinks from previous installs

### Symlink Layout

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── em:skill:brainstorming/
│   └── SKILL.md  ->  /path/to/em-team/skills/foundation/brainstorming/brainstorming.md
├── em:skill:test-driven-development/
│   └── SKILL.md  ->  /path/to/em-team/skills/development/test-driven-development/test-driven-development.md
├── em:skill:react/
│   └── SKILL.md  ->  /path/to/em-team/skills/expert-react/react/react.md
├── em:code-review/         # Agent wrappers also live here
│   └── SKILL.md  ->  /path/to/em-team/.claude/skills/em-code-review.md
└── ...
```

Skills are invoked by name in Claude Code:

```
Use the brainstorming skill to explore this feature idea
Use the test-driven-development skill to implement the auth module
Use the react skill to build the dashboard component
```
