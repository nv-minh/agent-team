**Product:** $PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION

## Review Plan

### Stage 1: Business Requirements Review (Product Manager)
**Agent:** \`duck:product\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: product-manager - Review requirements for: $PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION"

**Assessment:**
- Requirements validation (problem, solution, business value, feasibility)
- GAP analysis (current vs desired state)
- Acceptance criteria review (clarity, testability, completeness)
- Market fit assessment (problem, solution, market validation)
- User story validation (INVEST criteria)
- Business impact and ROI

### Stage 2: Technical Feasibility Review (Architect)
**Agent:** \`duck:architect\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: architect - Assess technical feasibility for: $PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION"

**Assessment:**
- Technical feasibility
- Technical options and trade-offs
- Architecture impact
- Development effort estimation
- Technical risks
- Integration requirements

### Stage 3: Consolidated Product Assessment
**Agents:** \`duck:product\` + \`duck:architect\`

**Output:**
- Merged business and technical findings
- Business-technical alignment validation
- Prioritized requirements
- Actionable recommendations
- Go/No-Go decision

## Product Review Framework

### Requirements Validation
- Problem statement (clear, users identified, pain points understood)
- Solution validation (addresses problem, value prop clear)
- Business value (revenue/cost impact, strategic value, metrics)
- Feasibility (technical, resources, timeline, dependencies)

### GAP Analysis
- Business GAP (alignment with strategy, priority, opportunity cost)
- User GAP (user needs, validation, data vs assumptions)
- Technical GAP (tech stack, feasibility, risks)
- Process GAP (operations, workflows, training)
- Data GAP (requirements, availability, collection)

### Acceptance Criteria Review
- Clarity (unambiguous, clear definition of done, measurable)
- Testability (automated, manual, pass/fail clear, edge cases)
- Completeness (happy path, errors, edge cases, boundaries)
- Traceability (linked to user story, requirement, business goal)

### User Story Validation (INVEST)
- **I**ndependent (can be developed independently)
- **N**egotiable (details can be negotiated)
- **V**aluable (clear value to user, supports business goal)
- **E**stimable (team can estimate, requirements clear)
- **S**mall (can be completed in sprint)
- **T**estable (acceptance criteria defined, can be verified)
