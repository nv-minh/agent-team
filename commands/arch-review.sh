# Architecture Review Workflow

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Architecture:** $ARCH_DESCRIPTION

## Review Plan

### Stage 1: Architecture Analysis (Architect)
**Agent:** \`duck:architect\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: architect - Review architecture for: $ARCH_DESCRIPTION"

**Assessment:**
- Architectural pattern identification (Layered, Hexagonal, Microservices, Event-Driven)
- Architecture principles (high cohesion, low coupling, separation of concerns)
- Technical design review
- Scalability analysis
- ADR review (if applicable)

### Stage 2: Deep Technical Review (Staff Engineer)
**Agent:** \`duck:staff\`
**Trigger:** "Agent: staff-engineer - Deep technical review for: $ARCH_DESCRIPTION"

**Assessment:**
- Cross-service impact analysis
- Dependency mapping
- Performance implications
- Integration complexity
- Risk identification

### Stage 3: Consolidated Architecture Assessment
**Agents:** \`duck:architect\` + \`duck:staff\`

**Output:**
- Merged architecture and technical findings
- Identified architectural risks
- Prioritized recommendations
- Actionable roadmap

## Architecture Patterns

### LAYERED
- Unidirectional data flow
- Upper layers depend on lower layers
- Good for: Traditional CRUD, small teams

### HEXAGONAL
- Domain core with no dependencies
- Ports and adapters pattern
- Good for: Complex domains, technology uncertainty

### MICROSERVICES
- Independent services with own databases
- API gateway and service mesh
- Good for: Multiple teams, high scaling, fault isolation

### EVENT-DRIVEN
- Event producers, broker, consumers
- Async processing
- Good for: Async processing, real-time updates, high scalability

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Architectural pattern identified
- [ ] Architecture principles evaluated
- [ ] Technical design reviewed
- [ ] Cross-service impact analyzed
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Scalability assessed
- [ ] Scorecard completed

## Output

Consolidated Architecture Review Report with:
- Executive Summary
- Architecture Pattern Analysis
- Principles Review
- Technical Design Assessment
- Cross-Service Impact
- Scalability Analysis
- Findings and Recommendations
- Architecture Scorecard
- Decision
