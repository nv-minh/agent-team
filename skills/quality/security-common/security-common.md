# Security Common Knowledge Base

## Overview

This skill provides a centralized reference for security checks across all reviewer agents. It eliminates duplication and ensures consistent security assessment practices.

## OWASP Top 10 (2021) Quick Reference

### A01: Broken Access Control
**Description:** Users can act outside of their intended permissions.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Vertical privilege escalation (regular user → admin)
- Horizontal privilege escalation (user A → user B)
- Bypassing access control checks via URL manipulation
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
- Missing authentication on sensitive endpoints

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Verify role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced"
  - "Test URL parameter manipulation (e.g., /user/123 → /user/456)"
  - "Check for IDOR vulnerabilities by accessing other users' resources"
  - "Verify API endpoints have proper authentication/authorization"
  - "Test for admin panel bypass"
```

**Fix:**
- Implement proper RBAC on all endpoints
- Use UUIDs instead of sequential IDs
- Validate ownership on every request
- Use deny-by-default for access control

---

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
**Description:** Cryptographic failures leading to sensitive data exposure.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Storing passwords in plaintext
- Using weak encryption algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
- Missing encryption for sensitive data in transit
- Missing encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Hardcoded encryption keys

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Search for plaintext passwords in code/database"
  - "Check for weak hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA1)"
  - "Verify HTTPS is enforced (no HTTP)"
  - "Check for hardcoded API keys, secrets, or certificates"
  - "Verify sensitive data is encrypted at rest"
```

**Fix:**
- Use bcrypt/argon2 for passwords (salt rounds ≥ 10)
- Enforce HTTPS with HSTS headers
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (AES-256)
- Use key management services (KMS)

---

### A03: Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP)
**Description:** Untrusted data sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL injection via user input
- NoSQL injection (MongoDB, etc.)
- OS command injection
- LDAP injection
- XXE (XML External Entity)

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:

  - "Check for unsanitized user input in queries"
  - "Look for shell_exec, system(), eval() with user input"
  - "Test SQL injection payloads: ' OR '1'='1"
  - "Check for ORM bypass with raw queries"
```

**Fix:**
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Use ORM with proper escaping
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use allowlists for input validation
- Implement principle of least privilege for database users

---

### A04: Insecure Design
**Description:** System design flaws that enable security issues.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**

- Insecure authentication flows
- Lack of rate limiting
- Missing anti-automation controls
- Insecure session management

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Review authentication flow for security weaknesses"
  - "Check for rate limiting on sensitive endpoints"
  - "Verify session timeout and invalidation"
  - "Test for brute force protection"
  - "Check CAPTCHA on sensitive forms"
```

**Fix:**
- Design security controls from the start
- Implement rate limiting (e.g., 10 requests/minute)
- Use CAPTCHA for sensitive operations
- Implement session timeout (15-30 minutes)
- Design secure authentication flows

---

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
**Description:** Improperly configured security settings.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Default credentials unchanged
- Debug mode enabled in production
- Verbose error messages exposing internals
- Unnecessary features enabled
- Outdated components with known vulnerabilities

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Check for default passwords (admin/admin, etc.)"
  - "Verify debug mode is disabled in production"
  - "Test for verbose error messages revealing stack traces"
  - "Check for unnecessary enabled features/services"
  - "Run dependency audit (npm audit, snyk, etc.)"
```

**Fix:**
- Change all default credentials
- Disable debug mode in production
- Use generic error messages for users
- Remove unused features and dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date

---

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**Description:** Using libraries with known vulnerabilities.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Outdated dependencies
- Using unsupported versions
- Missing security patches
- Vulnerable third-party APIs

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Run 'npm audit' or equivalent package manager audit"
  - "Check for CVEs in dependencies"
  - "Verify all dependencies are maintained"
  - "Check for outdated package versions"
  - "Use tools like Snyk, Dependabot, or GitHub Advisory Database"
```

**Fix:**
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use automated dependency scanning
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use semantic versioning with care

---

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
**Description:** Authentication and session management weaknesses.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Test for weak password requirements"
  - "Check for credential stuffing vulnerabilities"
  - "Test session fixation attacks"
  - "Verify MFA is implemented for sensitive accounts"
  - "Test password reset flow for security issues"
```

**Fix:**
- Enforce strong password policies (≥12 chars, complexity)
- Implement rate limiting on login
- Regenerate session IDs after login
- Implement MFA for sensitive accounts
- Use secure password reset (time-limited tokens)

---

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
**Description:** Code and infrastructure without integrity verification.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Using untrusted dependencies
- Insecure deserialization
- Auto-updates without signature verification
- CI/CD pipelines without integrity checks

**Detection:**
```yaml
checks:
  - "Verify package integrity (checksums, signatures)"
  - "Check for unsafe deserialization"
  - "Review CI/CD pipeline security"

```

**Fix:**

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Description:** Server fetches remote resource without validating user-supplied URL.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Fetching user-supplied URLs

```

**Fix:**
- Validate and sanitize all URLs
- Use allowlists for permitted domains
- Network segmentation for internal services
- Disable unused internal services
- Use dedicated SSRF protection libraries

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### SQL Injection
```yaml
pattern: "SQL query with string concatenation"
vulnerable: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + userId + "'"
safe: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [userId]
detection: "Search for '+' with SQL queries, string interpolation in queries"
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
```yaml
pattern: "Unsanitized user input rendered to HTML"
vulnerable: "<div>" + userInput + "</div>"
safe: "<div>" + escapeHtml(userInput) + "</div>"
detection: "Search for HTML rendering with user input without escaping"
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
```yaml
pattern: "State-changing operation without CSRF token"
vulnerable: "POST /transfer without CSRF token"
safe: "POST /transfer with CSRF token header"
detection: "Check for missing CSRF tokens on state-changing endpoints"
```

### Hardcoded Secrets
```yaml
pattern: "Secrets hardcoded in source code"
vulnerable: "const API_KEY = 'sk-1234567890abcdef'"
safe: "const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY"
detection: "Search for API keys, passwords, tokens in source code"
```

### Path Traversal
```yaml
pattern: "Unsanitized file path from user input"
vulnerable: "fs.readFileSync('/uploads/' + filename)"
safe: "fs.readFileSync(path.join('/uploads', sanitize(filename)))"
detection: "Search for file operations with user input"
```

### Insecure Deserialization
```yaml
pattern: "Deserializing untrusted data"
vulnerable: "JSON.parse(userInput) or pickle.loads(userData)"
safe: "Validate schema before deserialization"
detection: "Search for deserialization functions with user input"
```
