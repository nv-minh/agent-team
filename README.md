## 🚀 Core Features & Major Improvements

### ✨ TDD Auto-Retry Loop (NEW)

**Automated test failure capture and intelligent retry system**

Never manually copy-paste test errors again! The TDD Auto-Retry mechanism automatically captures test failures and feeds them back to AI agents for fixing.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🔄 **Exponential Backoff**: 1s → 2s → 4s delays between retries (max 3)
- 📊 **Auto Error Capture**: Saves test failures as JSON with full context
- 🤖 **AI-Friendly Format**: Structured output for seamless AI consumption
- 💾 **Persistent Context**: Survives bash session restarts
- 🎯 **Exit Code Convention**: 0=success, 42=retry, 43=max exceeded

**Real-World Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates manual error copy-paste workflow
- ✅ Reduces noise from flaky tests with exponential backoff
- ✅ Maintains TDD Iron Law (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
- ✅ Seamless pre-commit hook integration

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Automatic in pre-commit hook
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
# Tests run with auto-retry if they fail

# Manual usage
./tests/tdd-retry-wrapper.sh run "npm test" 3
./tests/tdd-context-manager.sh status
./tests/tdd-context-manager.sh format  # AI-friendly error display
```

**Documentation:** `docs/TDD-AUTO-RETRY.md`

---

### ✨ Token Summarization (NEW)

**Intelligent token management prevents Tech Lead context overflow**

Solves the distributed mode token overflow problem with Haiku-powered summarization that preserves 100% of critical information.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🎯 **150K Token Threshold**: Triggers summarization when reports exceed limit
- 🤖 **Haiku Integration**: Uses Claude Haiku model for quality summaries
- 💯 **100% Information Preservation**: Critical/high issues completely preserved
- 🔧 **Rule-Based Fallback**: Graceful degradation when Haiku unavailable
- ⚡ **Automatic Integration**: Works seamlessly with report consolidation

**Information Preservation Strategy:**
- **100% Preserve**: Critical issues, high issues, YAML frontmatter, scorecard
- **80% Preserve**: Executive summary, medium issues, recommendations
- **30% Preserve**: Detailed analysis, code examples, verbose explanations

**Real-World Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents Tech Lead context overflow (>200K tokens)
- ✅ Reduces consolidated reports by 40-87%
- ✅ Preserves all decision-critical information
- ✅ Transparent metadata tracking

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Token counting
./scripts/token-counter.sh estimate report.md
./scripts/token-counter.sh check report.md 150000

# Summarization
./scripts/haiku-client.sh summarize report.md report.summarized.md 80000

# Consolidation with auto-summarization
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh consolidate
# Automatically checks tokens and summarizes if needed
```

**Documentation:** `docs/TOKEN-SUMMARIZATION.md`

---

### ✨ Knowledge Persistence (NEW)

**Project convention learning ensures consistent agent output across all tasks**

The Codebase-Mapper Agent extracts project conventions and persists them to a knowledge base that all agents automatically consume, ensuring consistent code style, naming patterns, and architectural decisions.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🧠 **Automatic Extraction**: Learns naming conventions, code style, architectural patterns
- 💾 **Persistent Knowledge Base**: Stores in `.claude/knowledge/` directory
- 🤖 **Agent Consumption**: All agents automatically load and apply conventions
- 🎯 **Pattern Matching**: Identifies and documents recurring patterns
- 📚 **Code Examples**: Saves representative samples for reference

**What Gets Extracted:**
- **Naming Conventions**: Files, functions, variables, classes, constants
- **Code Style**: Indentation, line length, quotes, semicolons, patterns
- **Architecture Patterns**: Layered, hexagonal, microservices, etc.
- **Testing Conventions**: Test structure, naming, coverage requirements
- **Git Conventions**: Commit format, branch naming, PR guidelines
- **Error Handling**: Error classes, logging patterns, retry logic

**Knowledge Files:**
- `project-conventions.md` - All project naming and coding conventions
- `coding-style.md` - Code formatting and style guidelines
- `architecture-patterns.md` - Detected architectural patterns
- `dependencies.md` - Dependency mapping and integration points
- `examples/` - Representative code samples

**Real-World Impact:**
- ✅ All agents follow consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Code style matches project patterns automatically
- ✅ Architectural decisions are respected across agents
- ✅ New team members benefit from learned conventions
- ✅ Reduces "code style drift" over time

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Extract and persist project knowledge
/em:codebase-mapper Analyze this project and save conventions

# View knowledge base
cat .claude/knowledge/project-conventions.md
cat .claude/knowledge/coding-style.md

# Update knowledge when conventions change
/em:codebase-mapper Update knowledge base

# Agents automatically use knowledge
/em:frontend-expert Create user profile component
# Agent automatically loads and follows project conventions
```

**Agent Integration:**
All agents automatically load knowledge when starting tasks:
1. Check `.claude/knowledge/` exists
2. Load `project-conventions.md`
3. Study code examples
4. Apply conventions to work
5. Validate output against patterns

**Documentation:** `agents/codebase-mapper.md`, `.claude/knowledge/README.md`

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Distributed Agent Orchestration System

EM-Team includes a **distributed agent orchestration system** that solves token context overflow by running agents in separate tmux sessions.

#### Problem Solved

When working with complex tasks requiring multiple specialist agents, token context limits become a bottleneck. Traditional approaches:
- ❌ Run all agents sequentially (slow)
- ❌ Truncate context (lose information)
- ❌ Increase token limits (expensive)

#### Our Solution

**Parallel agent execution in isolated tmux sessions:**

#### Architecture Components

**1. Orchestration Layer**
- `distributed-orchestrator.sh` - Creates and manages tmux sessions
- `session-coordinator.sh` - High-level coordination logic
- `session-sync.sh` - Context synchronization across sessions

**2. Session Management**
- `session-manager.sh` - List, kill, broadcast to sessions
- Each agent runs in isolated tmux window
- Shared directories for communication

**3. Message Protocol**
- `distributed-messaging.md` - Message format specification
- YAML-based task assignments and status updates
- Queue-based processing (pending → processing → completed)

**4. Report System with Token Summarization**
- `report-format.md` - Standard report structure with summarization metadata
- `consolidate-reports.sh` - Collects, merges, and summarizes reports
- `token-counter.sh` - Estimates token counts using tiktoken
- `haiku-client.sh` - Intelligent summarization using Haiku model
- **Automatic Summarization**: Reports >150K tokens → Summarized to ~80K tokens
- **100% Information Preservation**: Critical/high issues completely preserved
- YAML frontmatter with findings, recommendations, next steps
- Summarization metadata: `summarized`, `original_token_count`, `summarized_token_count`

**5. Quality & Testing Infrastructure**
- `tdd-retry-wrapper.sh` - Auto-retry mechanism for TDD with exponential backoff
- `tdd-context-manager.sh` - Error capture and AI-friendly formatting
- `pre-commit hook` - Integrated TDD auto-retry into git workflow
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1s → 2s → 4s delays between retries (max 3)
- **Auto Error Capture**: JSON context with full test output
- **Exit Code Convention**: 0=success, 42=retry, 43=max exceeded

**5. Communication Flow**

```
1. Orchestrator receives task
2. Orchestrator creates task assignments
3. Task assignments placed in queue/
4. Specialist agents pick up tasks
5. Agents generate reports in shared/
6. Token check: Reports >150K? → Summarize using Haiku
7. Reports consolidated into summary
8. Token check: Consolidated >150K? → Summarize
9. Consolidated report returned to user (within 200K budget)
```

**6. Quality Gates (NEW)**

```
Development Phase:
- Write code → TDD Auto-Retry captures failures
- Test fails → Auto-retry with exponential backoff
- Error context saved → AI reads and fixes
- Auto-re-test → Success or manual intervention

Distributed Mode:
- Agent reports generated → Token counting
- Exceeds 150K? → Haiku summarization
- 100% critical info preserved → Tech Lead receives summary
- Within 200K budget → No context overflow
```

#### Benefits

✅ **Parallel Execution** - Multiple agents work simultaneously
✅ **Isolated Context** - Each agent has full 200K token budget
✅ **No Information Loss** - Complete context preservation with intelligent summarization
✅ **Scalable** - Add more agents without token issues (summarization prevents overflow)
✅ **Observable** - Full audit trail via reports with summarization metadata
✅ **Automated TDD** - Auto-retry mechanism eliminates manual error copy-paste
✅ **Token Efficient** - Haiku-based summarization reduces reports by 40-87%
✅ **Quality Assured** - 100% preservation of critical/high issues in summaries

## 🚀 Usage

### Standard Agent/Skill/Workflow Usage (Updated v1.2.0)

#### Option 1: Discovery-First Approach (Recommended)

**Validate ideas before building:**

```bash
# Step 1: Validate product idea
/office-hours I have an idea for a AI-powered code reviewer for startups

# Step 2: Run discovery (if score 8-10 or 5-7)
/em:discovery-process We need to improve our checkout conversion rate

# Step 3: Coordinate reviews
/em:autoplan Coordinate reviews for our new authentication feature

# Step 4: Create implementation plan
/em:planner Create plan for authentication feature

# Step 5: Execute
/em:executor Execute plan with atomic commits

# Step 6: Capture learnings
/em:learn Capture patterns, pitfalls, and ADRs from this project
```

#### Option 2: Direct Development

**Skip discovery, build directly:**

### Example 1: Building a New Feature

```bash
# Step 1: Brainstorm the feature
/em:skill:brainstorming Explore a user authentication feature

# Step 2: Create a spec
/em:skill:spec-driven-development Create a spec for authentication

# Step 3: Write a plan
/em:skill:writing-plans Break down the implementation

# Step 4: Execute the plan
/subagent-driven-development Implement the plan

# Step 5: Review the code
/em:code-reviewer Review the authentication implementation

# Step 6: Deploy
/em:deployment Deploy the authentication feature
```

### Example 2: Fixing a Bug

```bash
# Step 1: Debug systematically
/em:skill:systematic-debugging Investigate the login bug

# Step 2: Fix the root cause
# (After root cause is identified)
/em:skill:test-driven-development Fix the bug

# Step 3: Verify the fix
/em:skill:api-testing Verify the login endpoint works

# Step 4: Code review
/em:code-reviewer Review the bug fix
```

### Example 3: Distributed Investigation (Complex Tasks)

For complex tasks requiring multiple specialist agents:

```bash
# Start distributed orchestration
cd /path/to/em:team
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh start

# Attach to orchestrator window
tmux attach -t claude-work:orchestrator

# Trigger distributed investigation
/em:distributed Investigate authentication bug across entire stack

# View consolidated report
cat /tmp/claude-work-reports/techlead/consolidated-report.md

# Stop when done
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh stop
```

# This creates a tmux session with multiple agent windows:
# - orchestrator (Tech Lead)
# - backend (Backend Expert)
# - frontend (Frontend Expert)
# - database (Database Expert)

# Attach to orchestrator window
tmux attach -t claude-work:orchestrator

# Trigger investigation
/em:techlead-orchestrator Investigate authentication bug across the entire stack

# The orchestrator will:
# 1. Analyze the task
# 2. Delegate subtasks to specialist agents
# 3. Collect findings from all agents
# 4. Consolidate into a comprehensive report

# View consolidated report
cat /tmp/claude-work-reports/techlead/consolidated-report.md

# Stop distributed orchestration when done
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh stop
```

### Distributed System Commands

```bash
# Start distributed orchestration
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh start

# List active sessions
./scripts/session-manager.sh list

# Check queue status
./distributed/session-coordinator.sh queue-status

# Check agent status
./distributed/session-coordinator.sh agent-status

# List available reports
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh list

# Consolidate all reports
./scripts/consolidate-reports.sh consolidate

# Broadcast message to all agent windows
./scripts/session-manager.sh broadcast "echo 'Hello all agents'"

# Stop distributed orchestration
./scripts/distributed-orchestrator.sh stop
```

### When to Use Distributed System

**Use Distributed System when:**
- ✅ Task requires analysis across multiple domains (backend, frontend, database)
- ✅ Task is complex and needs specialist expertise
- ✅ You need parallel investigation for speed
- ✅ Task context is large (approaching token limits)
- ✅ You need comprehensive audit trail

**Use Standard Agents when:**
- ✅ Task is straightforward and single-domain
- ✅ Quick investigation needed
- ✅ Task doesn't require parallel processing
- ✅ Simpler workflow preferred

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify system functionality:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
cd tests
./run-e2e-tests.sh

# Run specific test suites
./test-distributed-orchestrator.sh
./test-session-manager.sh
./test-consolidate-reports.sh
./test-messaging-protocol.sh
./test-report-consolidation.sh

# Run manual tests (follow the guide)
cat manual-test-with-agents.md
```
